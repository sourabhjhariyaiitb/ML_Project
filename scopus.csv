Sapelli (Entandrophragma cylindricum), the African mahogany, and Tali (Erythrophleum suaveolens) are food sources for these caterpillars; they are also among the most important timber species harvested from Congo Basin forests. This study quantified the yield of caterpillars from harvestable and precommercial sizes of trees of these two timber species to better understand the impact of logging on the availability of edible caterpillars to local people, and the implications for managing both timber and non-timber resources in industrial timber concessions. Caterpillars were collected and weighed beneath 50 Sapelli trees 23–190 cm DBH and 170 Tali trees 22–174 cm DBH on two timber concessions, from mid-August to mid-September, over two years. Caterpillars were found to descend from the trees during 5 days each year, and quantities varied between years. In both sample years, yields were significantly higher from harvestable trees larger than the minimum cutting diameter than from precommercial trees. Each harvestable Sapelli tree (≥ 80 cm DBH), yielded an average of 11.3 kg fresh weight of I. oyemensis year-1; smaller, precommercial trees yielded 5.4 kg tree−1year−1. Each harvestable Tali tree (≥ 60 cm DBH) yielded an average of 9.1 kg of C. forda year−1, as compared to 5.7 kg tree−1year−1 from precommercial trees. This means that industrial timber harvesting, which removes trees larger than the minimum cutting diameter, has a disproportionate effect on the availability of caterpillars. However, trees below the minimum cutting diameter also yield caterpillars, and may occur at higher densities. Guidelines that limit harvesting on steep slopes or near watercourses, or that call for retaining large trees as seed sources, also safeguard caterpillar yields. However, multiple resource management should consider proactive measures, which could include zoning areas near villages as sources of edible caterpillars, and protecting those trees from logging. © 2021","Concession; Entandrophragma cylindricum; Erythrophleum suaveolens; Forest management; NTFP; Wild foods",,"Snook, L.K.; Forest Management and Restoration, Via di San Domenico 1, Italy; email: l.snook@cgiar.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",26667193,,,,"English","Tree.

From micro data collected by a survey of poor, rural households living in the mountainous region of Central Vietnam, a structural equation model (SEM) incorporating the six factors of household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, forest characteristics, willingness to participate in NTFP value chains, and financial effects of NTFP value chains was established. An empirical study of the effects of farmers' behaviors on NTFP financial value chains was also conducted. The results showed that household head characteristics, household characteristics, reputation statuses of households, and forest characteristics were positively correlated with people's willingness to participate in NTFP value chains and increase the financial efficiency of the value chains. However, each factor has a different level of influence. Additional empirical factors affecting farmers' awareness of poverty reduction policies were investigated. It was found that the more farmers understand sustainable poverty reduction policies, the more willing they are to participate in the value chains. The willingness to participate in the value chains strongly affects the financial performances of the value chains. Farmers are expected to be willing to fulfill their obligations and their enthusiasm for participating in the value chains has increased the financial efficiency of the value chains. In the future, the government can cooperate with official financial institutions, policy finance institutions, and local rural intermediaries to increase public financial knowledge, poverty reduction policies and projects in poor areas, and the participation of poor farmers, as well as solve their credit problems. Meanwhile, in developing a financial model of new NTFP value chains, more attention should be paid to the needs of farmers and this model should be built with the aim of the sustainable development of NTFP value chains. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Structural equation model (SEM); Sustainable poverty reduction; Value chain; Vietnam","Behavioral research; Efficiency; Finance; Rural areas; Timber; Financial efficiency; Financial institution; Financial modeling; Financial performance; Mountainous regions; Non-timber forest products; Structural equation modeling; Sustainable forestry; Forestry; Chains; Characteristics; Development; Efficiency; Finance; Forestry; Reduction; Vietnam","Lv, J.H.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: lvjiehuajiaoshou@126.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

However, this sustainable way of wastewater use has not been given much attention and exploration. This study focused on the consumer preference for fish grown in treated wastewater as well as the effect of aeration on the growth performance and economic benefit of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) grown in treated wastewater. Two hundred (200) respondents from two communities (Chirapatre and Gyinyase) near the wastewater treatment plant in Kumasi were interviewed to determine their willingness to accept and pay for African catfish grown in treated wastewater. For the growth trial, a total of 600 fish (of average initial weight 39.12g) were stocked in two maturation ponds with 4 h (3:00am–7:00am) of aeration daily. The trial lasted for 12 weeks and variables monitored included the survival, growth performance (weight gain, specific growth rate, and yield) and water quality. Fish cultured in non-aerated wastewater ponds (NWFPs) under similar conditions as in aerated wastewater-fed ponds (AWFPs) served as control. The results indicated most important considerations for consumers in their choice of fish to consume were in order of importance; food safety, freshness of fish, taste and packaging. The proximity of consumers to the treatment plant, the price of fish, religion, and age and whether or not they were fish consumers affected their willingness to pay for African catfish grown in the treated wastewater significantly. For the growth trial, dissolved oxygen concentrations in the aerated ponds were significantly higher than in the NWFPs and this led to more than a doubling of the growth rates in the African catfish grown in the AWFPs (189.10g ± 11.32) as compared to the NWFPs (90.70g ± 11.59). The pond aeration improved fish growth significantly (p < 0.0098). On economic benefit, the aerated system yielded profits of 618.83 (€103.13) as compared to a loss of 104.99 (€17.50), which was incurred in the non-aerated ponds. Education of the consumers on the process of wastewater treatment and establishment of food safety guidelines will therefore be recommended to increase consumer interest in consuming fish from the treated wastewater. © 2021 The Authorswastewater, African catfish, wastewater ponds © 2021 The Authors","African catfish; Wastewater; Wastewater ponds",,"Mark, Y.-A.; TriMark Aquaculture CentreGhana; email: yeboahagyepong6@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",24058440,,,,"English","Heliyon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102373468

It is crucial to understand the scale and nature of such forest conversions and how they affect forest-dependent communities as a basis for prudent forest management and protection of indigenous livelihoods. This study analyses natural forest conversions and their impacts on tribal communities in the southern Western Ghats, a globally significant biodiversity hotspot. It focuses on two tribal settlements in protected forests within the catchment of the Achankovil River. The study involves time series analysis of forest cover change, based on a historical map and satellite images, field mapping of changes in the tribal communities’ areas of operation, household surveys, and focus group discussions. The analysis shows that the area of protected forest decreased by 53 % from 1978 to 2015. As a result, the size of the tribal communities’ gathering areas considerably shrunk, resulting in a decline in their collection of non-timber forest products and increased dependency on forest plantations labour for their livelihood. This is especially critical as the tribal communities still prefer to depend on natural forests for their sustenance. Preservation of natural forests is hence crucial not only for biodiversity conservation, but also to protect socio-economic and cultural traits of tribal populations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Forest conversion; Hunter-Gatherer; Non-Timber forest products (NTFP); Operational area; Tribal people; Tropical forests","biodiversity; deforestation; hunter-gatherer; indigenous population; nontimber forest product; tropical forest; India; Western Ghats","Vijayan, D.; Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF)Germany; email: Dhanya.Vijayan@Zalf.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098495327

Jernang is a type of rattan that produces a resin known as ""dragon's blood""which has many benefits such as dye raw materials in the ceramics, marble, wood, paper and pharmaceutical industries. Aceh province is one potential area for Jernang development. Supply chain is a complex system that has elements that are orderly, interrelated, dynamic, have specific goals and are probabilistic. In the Jernang supply chain there are risks that can cause losses and failures in production. Failure in production does not only occur at the end process but can also occur at the beginning or when the production process is being carried out. Through the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method, it is expected that each form of failure can be identified in the production process. The results identified indicate that nineteen risk factors at the producer level. Based on the calculation of Risk Priority Number (RPN), the risk of decreasing production results is the most important risk.

However, mapping these particular land use patterns in rural heterogeneous landscapes is challenging because their potential signatures on the landscape cannot be positively identified without fine-scale land use data for validation. Using field-mapped resource areas and household survey data from participatory mapping research, we combined various Landsat-derived indices with ancillary data associated with human habitation to model the intensity of grazing and NTFP collection activities at 100-m spatial resolution. The study area is situated centrally within a transboundary southern African landscape that encompasses community-based organization (CBO) areas across three countries. We conducted four iterations of pixel-based random forest models, modifying the variable set to determine which of the covariates are most informative, using the best fit predictions to summarize and compare resource use intensity by resource type and across communities. Pixels within georeferenced, field-mapped resource areas were used as training data. All models had overall accuracies above 60% but those using proxies for human habitation were more robust, with overall accuracies above 90%. The contribution of Landsat data as utilized in our modeling framework was negligible, and further research must be conducted to extract greater value from Landsat or other optical remote sensing platforms to map these land use patterns at moderate resolution. We conclude that similar population proxy covariates should be included in future studies attempting to characterize communal resource use when traditional spectral signatures do not adequately capture resource use intensity alone. This study provides insights into modeling resource use activity when leveraging both remotely sensed data and proxies for human habitation in heterogeneous, spectrally mixed rural land areas. © 2021 by the authors.

Different support policies have created different development opportunities for local communities and farmers, which have led to changes in forest use by farmers and their forest-related livelihoods. The empirical results indicate that the use of forest resources by communities and farmers is changing from traditional consumptive uses, such as timber harvest and the collection of nontimber products, to nonconsumptive uses such as ecotourism, forest farming and forest guard. While the share of farmers who are dependent on forests has generally been similar (30% -39%), farmers who are engaged in different types of forest-related activities have shown significant income differentiation. With more participation in eco-tourism, farmers are more likely to become a wealthy group with high income and high assets, whereas engaging in forest farming and logging and NTFP gathering is not conducive to increasing farmers' current incomes. The income inequality among the farmers in the study area is more serious than in other regions.

This study took Lin’an District in Zhejiang Province of China as an example for analysis. Using long-term (more than 40 years) data, system coupling and autoregressive distributed lag models were combined to analyze the effect of NTFP development on coordinated economic-ecological development. The results show that large-scale commercial NTFP development positively affected coordinated economic-ecological development, and a long-term stable equilibrium relationship between them existed. The degree of regional economic-ecological coupling increased from 0.05 in 1978 to 0.98 in 2019, and both area and value of NTFP had a significant effect on the coupling degree at the 5% level. These findings indicate that NTFP development is an effective method to promote the coordinated development of the economy and ecological environment especially in mountain areas, and the government should encourage NTFP development by ecological management, strengthening policy guidance, and providing technological innovation support, etc. © 2021 by the authors.

We found that 96% of those surveyed visit the local forest to collect NTFPs, mushrooms were the most frequently collected item, and the average income per year from NTFPs was $19 US. Also, most interviewees were not processing the raw materials collected, meaning that a value-added process for the NTFPs in the future could result in higher income possibility.

The estimates of this model indicate the importance of the size of economies, distance, common borders, exchange rates, average forest area, the natural forest closing (NFC) policy of the Vietnamese government, sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures, and the interaction of SPS and importers’ GDP (SPS–GDP) as determinants of Vietnam’s NTFP exports. The main result of this study is the distinct and contradictory effects of the NFC policy and SPS measures. While the NFC policy increases the value of Vietnam’s NTFP exports, SPS measures significantly decrease the exportation. Using the SPS–GDP interaction variable yields a noticeable result: the negative impact of SPS on NTFP trade decreases with increasing income of NTFP importers. Furthermore, the NFC needs to continue to implement policies to increase investments in the NTFP trade and increase the quality of NTFPs from planting, to harvesting, to processing to meet the requirements of future importers. The findings offer several implications both in theory and in practice for trade policies and economic development theory based on Vietnam’s forest resources. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

This research aimed to evaluate the current management and commercialization practices of NTFPs in the Uatumã Sustainable Development Reserve, through semistructured interviews with 23 family units and 7 local resellers of regional products. We considered the following variables to evaluate the commercialization potential: abundance of available NTFPs, interest of families, use and management practices, cost of production, productivity and profitability. Of the 24 NTFPs collected by the families, there was a greater representativeness in food products. Based on 9 potentiality indicators, we evaluated the 6 NTFPs with the highest frequency of commercialization. Supply and demand proved to be the determining variables in all NTFPs and the cost of labor proved to be the factor with the greatest impact on the cost of production. NTFPs are resources that contribute mainly to household food security. Ours results recommend an intensified management of copaíba (Copaifera L.), mainly for obtaining oil-resin, a product best evaluated by Family Units and with growing regional demand, according to retailers. © 2021.

This study addressed this knowledge gap by setting up different bee wood hives under three monoculture plantation stands of Tectona grandis Linn, Cedrela odorata L. and Terminalia superba Engl. in the Tano Offin Forest Reserve of Ghana. The experiment was laid using factorial in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) and replicated 3 times. The study revealed that plantations of Tectona grandis, Cedrela odorata and Terminalia superba were all suitable for honey production even though Cedrela odorata produced the lowest honey yield. The most significant factor that affected honey production was the type of wood used to construct the bee hive. Cedrela odorata wood hives were not suitable for beekeeping since none was colonized. However, Tectona grandis wood hives yielded the highest honey, bee wax and propolis of 57.81 kg/harvest, 6.44 kg/harvest, 2.30 kg/harvest respectively. Also, Tectona grandis wood hives generated a profit of US$ 443.48/harvest compared to US$ 201.17/harvest for Terminalia superba wood hives. Tree plantations under MTS can be added value through bee keeping. Incorporating beekeeping in plantations could bring other unintended benefits such as farmer's preparedness to protect the plantations from fires which is a major threat to plantation establishment. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.","Bee keeping; bee wax; honey quality; honey yield; Modified Taungya System; tree species stand; wood hive",,"Abugre, S.; Department of Forest Science, P.

Therefore, this study examines the contribution of NTFPs to rural livelihoods, its potential in poverty alleviation, and socioeconomic drivers of households’ collection of NTFPs. The study is based on primary data collected by using a structured questionnaire survey of 450 randomly selected households in Metema and Quara districts of Amhara region, Ethiopia along with key informant interviews, focus group discussion with residents, and from government offices. We adopted an income accounting model for apportioning components of total income for finding income from NTFPs and applied the Tobit regression model for our analysis and found that households are considerably dependent on NTFPs. Income from NTFPs accounts for 23.1% of the total household income. However, the level and pattern of reliance on these forest products vary across different socioeconomic groups. Income from NTFPs also helps 20% of the households to remain above the poverty line. Moreover, the study shows that age, household size, landholding, cooperative membership, per capita income, and access to extension service inﬂuence households’ dependence on NTFPs. Thus, we suggest that any policy intervention in dry forest areas should be planned without destructing the forest ecosystem. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","dry forest areas; ethiopia; Forest conservation; ntfps; poverty","Ecosystems; Regression analysis; Surveys; Timber; Forest ecosystem; Government offices; Non-timber forest products; Per capita income; Policy intervention; Poverty alleviation; Questionnaire surveys; Tobit regression; Forestry","Walle, Y.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, India; email: yibeltal_walle@yahoo.com",,"Bellwether Publishing, Ltd.",10549811,,,,"English","J.

Either a solution-based or a superior solvent-free mechanochemical protocol can be followed. X-Ray diffraction analyses of 26 products provided insight into the bond parameters and conformational rigidity of the molecular scaffold. In solid-state structures, sulfoximines with halo substituents on the S-bound arene are intermolecularly linked by C-X⋯OS (X = Cl, Br) halogen bonds. Hirshfeld surface analysis is used to assess the type of non-covalent contacts present in molecules. For mixtures of three different S-pyridyl-substituted NTFP-sulfoximines and N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) in CDCl3, association constants were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The data revealed a dependence of the halogen bond strength on the position of the pyridyl nitrogen indicating the presence of N-I⋯N(S-pyridyl) interactions. Neither the SO oxygen nor the tetrafluoropyridyl-substituted nitrogen of the sulfoximine appeared to be involved in halogen bonding. © the Partner Organisations.",,"Chlorine compounds; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Potassium hydroxide; Scaffolds; Surface analysis; X ray diffraction analysis; 1H NMR spectroscopy; Association constant; Conformational rigidity; Hirshfeld surfaces; Molecular scaffolds; Non-covalent contacts; Pentafluoropyridine; Solid-state structures; X ray crystallography","Bolm, C.; Institute of Organic Chemistry, Landoltweg 1, Germany; email: carsten.bolm@oc.rwth-aachen.de",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",20524110,,,,"English","Org.

This study assesses and discusses the current state of the art and trends in NTFP yield modelling in Europe and the integration of the models in multi-functional forest management planning at different spatial scales. Recent Findings: Climate-sensitive empirical yield models already exist not only for a variety of NTFPs that are economically important to forest owners (e.g. cork and pine nuts) but also for wild-gathered berries and mushrooms, the harvesting of which cannot be controlled by the forest landowner in all European countries. Several studies on multi-functional forest management planning consider the economic profitability of the joint production of timber and NTFP. Harvesting NTFPs can create significant additional incomes for forest owners, compared with timber production only. However, maximizing the economic returns from the joint production of timber and NTFPs often calls for changes in forest management practices. Summary: Continued efforts in modelling and predicting the yields of NTFPs have enabled forest managers to further expand the analyses of multi-functional forest planning and management in Europe. Climate-sensitive models also allow analyses on the potential effects of climate change on NTFP yields. New models and forest management practices are still needed for tree fruits, birch sap, a wider variety of wild edible mushrooms, specialty mushrooms cultivated on live trees as well as medicinal and edible forest herbs harvested for commercial value in Europe. © 2020, The Author(s).","Joint production; Multi-functional forest management; Non-wood forest products; NTFP; NWFP; Yield models",,"Miina, J.; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Yliopistokatu 6 B, Finland; email: jari.miina@luke.fi",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",21986436,,,,"English","Curr.

WEFs were used by one-fifth of all sampled households, independent of economic and urbanisation gradients and were grown in or collected mostly from surrounding areas. More households, usually in rural areas, used other wild foods and non-food NTFPs, which were often purchased from other collectors.

Deforestation restricts the availability of NTFPs. The aim of the study was, with point of departure in Jernang, to investigate the transition between collection and cultivation of NTFPs. A village survey encompassing 57 households involved in collection, cultivation and/or trade of Jernang in two villages with high NTFP collection was carried out. The study revealed that more than 20 species or species groups of NTFPs were collected, albeit many of them only occasionally and by few people. In addition to Jernang, tree legume pods (Parkia and Archidendron) were the most collected products. Collection of most NTFPs was gendered. Jernang was almost entirely collected by men, since it implies trekking in forest and climbing. Albeit Jernang collectors found that both quantity and income from collection had declined, very few considered to abandon collection. A combination of economic incentives, poor regulations, and psycho-cultural motives for collection and connectedness to forest lead to intensive harvest. The harvest was less intense for other reported NTFPs, which was explained by shorter harvest season, non-marketable products, bulkiness and poor storability. To compensate for declining wild resources, villagers had started cultivation of some NTFPs, primarily Jernang and legume trees. For Jernang, shortage of planting material and fear of theft of fruits were seen as the greatest barriers to cultivation. The study showed that decreased availability of wild NTFPs, high prices and lack of replacement species may lead to cultivation. Adoptability was restricted by both technical problems (e.g. propagules), competition with domesticated crops, and cultural habits. The study gives an insight into the process of domestication of NTFPs at the interface between collection and cultivation. © 2020 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences","Agroforestry; Collection; Domestication; Dragonblood; Forest access; Gender; Jernang; NTFP; Resin","cultivation; deforestation; domestic work; domestication; legume; monocotyledon; Indonesia; South Sumatra; Archidendron; Daemonorops","Schmidt, L.; Department of Geography and Natural Resource Management, Rolighedsvej 23, Denmark; email: lsc@ign.ku.dk",,"Elsevier B.V.",15735214,,,,"English","NJAS Wageningen J.

In this study conducted on the foothills of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, we assumed that the extraction of NTFPs by local communities is related to sex, income, age, household size, and distance from the forest. We interviewed 313 household heads from six villages. We employed a logistic regression with a logit link to test the significance among the variables. Younger females of larger households with lower income and less cultivated land cut fodder and collected firewood more frequently than other villagers. Firewood collection frequency decreased with increasing distance from village to forest whereas fodder collection frequency increased. Men collected medicinal plants more frequently than younger women and if the distance from the village was greater. For firewood and fodder extraction, inter-village variation was greater than intra-village variation, suggesting that differences in access to infrastructure and alternative fodder sites also strongly determined NTFP extraction.

The ‘Participative Innovation Platform’ (PIP) instrument has been developed to design and to continually adapt solutions and strategies for effective cooperation amongst value chain actors. The instrument is rooted in the action-oriented and social learning approach, combined with the concept of innovation systems. This paper presents findings from three PIPs conducted for upgrading non-timber forest product value chains in Ethiopia (bamboo, natural gums) and Sudan (gum Arabic). A comparative analysis of highest ranked contents revealed similarities in the challenges: lack of government support, poor infrastructure, producers’ lack of knowledge and skills, and lack of market information. Priority upgrading measures focused on producers’ knowledge, skills, and capacity to engage in collective action and to lobby interests, and on capital resources to invest in processing technology. It is concluded that although the PIP instrument presents an innovative way to upgrade forest-based value chains, the instrument requires a long-term process with frequently held platform meetings, conducted by neutral institutions with skilled moderators. Crucial in this process is the need to consistently verify and ensure that all actor groups of the chain are represented, and are confident they will derive benefits from the value chain upgrading. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bamboo; Ethiopia; Multi-stakeholder; Natural gums; Rural development; Sudan","bamboo; comparative study; forest management; innovation; local government; rural development; rural planning; stakeholder; Ethiopia; Sudan; Acacia senegal","Auch, E.; Institute of International Forestry and Forest Products, Germany; email: eckhard.auch@tu-dresden.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",18737617,,,,"English","Small-scale For.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091496259

The main objectives of this study were to identify and calculate the economic value from tangible/marketable perspective of the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) provided by peat swamp forest in Kampar, Sumatra, Indonesia. This is one of the largest remaining peat swamp forest ecosystems in the country. Seven villages located around that forest ecosystem with total forest cover area of 201,224 ha were chosen as samples. A conversion return approach was used to estimate the economic value of non-timber forest products. The results showed 18 kinds of non-timber forest products were identified, but only seven were used commercially by community. They are jungle rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), sago (Metroxylon sp.), swiftlet nest (Aerodramus fuciphagus), honey, betel nut (Areca catechu), Agathis resin (Agathis dammara), and pandan (Pandanus amaryllifolius Roxb.) The obtained economic value of NTFPs was very low, which was about Rp 9,367.4 (or US$0.68 ha-1 yr-1). Market development of non-timber forest products is then crucial, and the government should play an important role in promoting it in collaboration with private companies. Non-marketed non-timber forest products and various environmental services should also be taken into account to measure that peat swamp forest ecosystem value. Otherwise, concerns about the sustainability of that forest ecosystem in Indonesia due to undervaluation of forest resources will continue. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The majority of repong damar has been cut down, especially during the last 15 years. One of the reasons for decreasing community interest in managing repong dammar is the decreasing of dammar gum prices. This research aimed to analyze the market system of dammar cultivation in Pesisir Barat, Lampung Province. Descriptive analysis was used to determine the local community's knowledge, skill, and opinion in the trading channel. For further analysis, marketing margin and farmers' share were also used to analyze the price differentiation from the producer's level to the consumer's level. Based on the study results, there are three channels of the dammar gum market in Pesisir Barat Lampung. Most of the farmers (up to 85.71% of total) in Pekon Pahmungan use trading channels 1 and 2 to sell their harvested dammar. Meanwhile, based on the analysis of profit margin, it appears that farmers in channels 1 and 2 are trading actors that receive the lowest profit margin (IDR7,100 kg-1 and IDR8,100 kg-1) compared to trading channel 3 (IDR14,000 kg-1).

Bitter kola (Garcinia kola) is an indigenous multipurpose tree species in West and Central Africa, threatened by overexploitation and classified by the IUCN as vulnerable. Understanding local knowledge and management patterns in different socioecological contexts could contribute to designing strategies for conservation and long-term use of the species. In order to characterize the parts of the plant and the harvesting techniques that are used by different ethnic groups in Cameroon, we conducted surveys through the use of semi-structured questionnaires (N = 182) in six different sites covering different agro-ecological zones where the species is present (forest and savanna). Ethnic groups from the savanna agro-ecological zone shared similar patterns in G. kola organs/parts used and harvesting techniques, but these patterns differed among ethnic groups from the savanna and forest zones and within the forest zone. Ethnic groups from the savanna zone mainly harvest the species for its seeds that are used as stimulants. Conversely ethnic groups from the forest zone mainly collect bark and roots, and uses differ between agriculturalists (Fang and Bassa) and hunter-gatherers (Baka). These patterns have direct consequences on species management practices. Savanna farmers applied sustainable harvesting as they extract fruits and seeds and planting more trees in order to increase the species’ contribution to their livelihood. People in the forest zone destructively felled standing trees, threatening the species in its natural environment.

A number of Baka hunter-gatherer populations in south-eastern Cameroon became sedentarised in the 1950s, but still rely on hunting and gathering to meet their basic needs. The use of wild edible plants (WEP) by these communities remains largely undocumented. In this study, we record the diversity of WEP used by Baka people in dense rainforests in the Mintom region. The area still contains relatively undisturbed forest expanses, just south of the Dja Biosphere Reserve, one of the most important protected areas in the Congo Basin. Methods: We conducted two ethnobotanical surveys in 2019 in four villages on the Mintom road. In the first survey, we interviewed a total of 73 individuals to determine WEP usage. In our second survey, we specifically quantified WEP harvested and consumed daily in a number of households over a 2-week period during the major rainy season, when use of forest products is highest. Specimens of all recorded plants were collected and identified at the National Herbarium of Cameroon. Results: We documented 88 plant species and 119 unique species/plant organ/recipes in 1519 different citations. A total of 61 genera and 43 families were noted. Excluding 14 unidentified wild yam species, 17 WEP species had not been reported in previous ethnobotanical surveys of the Baka. Our results showed that cultivated starchy plant foods make up a significant proportion of our study population’s daily nutritional intake. Conclusions: A high diversity of WEP is consumed by the studied Baka communities. The study area is likely to be significant in terms of WEP diversity since 18 out of the 30 “key” non-timber forest products, NTFP, in Cameroon were mentioned. Documentation of the use of WEP by indigenous communities is vital to ensure the continuity of traditional knowledge and future food security. © 2020, The Author(s).","Africa; Baka people; Diversity indexes; Dja biosphere reserve; Ethnobotany; Food security; Hunter-gatherer; Wild edible plants","adult; article; biosphere; Cameroon; Congo; dietary intake; documentation; edible plant; ethnobotany; female; food security; household; human; human cell; human experiment; hunter-gatherer; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; rain forest; rainy season; yam","Funk, S.M.; Nature Heritage, St. Lawrence, United Kingdom; email: smf@natureheritage.org",,"BioMed Central Ltd",17464269,,,"33092623","English","J.

Mining operations are one driver of land loss with negative implications for people. This study assesses the livelihood effects of open-cast mining on a rural communal land village that lost 8 000 ha of land and compares it to another village nearby that did not. The results suggest that the loss of land and the ecosystem services they provide has negatively affected people's livelihood strategies and outcomes. On average, only 23 % of households in the affected village had crop fields compared to an adjacent village, that did not lose land to the mine, where 90 % of households had a crop field. This accounts for substantial losses in income through agriculture, both as cash earnings and savings, and negatively affects household food security. As a result of the mine the affected community has also lost access to grazing, and now many households must pay to graze their livestock in other areas. Furthermore, the option to harvest several key natural resources (provisioning services) or non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as wild fruits and vegetables, edible insects, fuelwood, and to a lesser extent resources like reeds and medicinal plants were lost due to the mine, negatively impacting local livelihoods. NTFPs are important for rural livelihoods as they allow for cash saving, income generation and act as a safety net or fall-back option during times of increased vulnerability. The findings also give a good indication of changes in agriculture and resource use over time and the varying reasons for this. Other negative effects from the mine included; cracking of houses due to blasting, dust pollution, water contamination, social and cultural effects, community alterations and conflicts, and very little was seen to be gained in terms of employment through Social Labour Plans (SLPs) or corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Households in the village affected by the mine lose approximately R 15 000 per year through losses of agricultural potential and the ability to collect NTFPs, which is larger than the annual cash incomes for most households. This value is likely to be an underestimate of the total value lost, as reductions in grazing potential and the loss of supporting, regulating and cultural ecosystem services were not included in this figure. This study highlights the importance of considering land access and associated land-based livelihoods in rural communal land areas in the context of disturbance and change. Recommendations for future assessments and policy on compensation for rural communities are made and issues relating to CSR are discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); Human well-being; Legislation; Policy; Social-ecological change; Vulnerability","corporate social responsibility; ecosystem service; land degradation; land use change; livelihood; mining; opencast mining; rural area; Limpopo; South Africa; Hexapoda",,,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086890286

Timber products and their derivatives, which are limited by harvest periods, become increasingly limited and cause a decline in forest value. Non-timber forest products, known as non-timber forest products (NTFPs), are of concern to stakeholders in the forestry sector. However, the broad type of NTFPs and special characteristics pose challenges in managing NTFPs. This paper summarizes the types of NTFPs based on several references and presents alternatives in the management of NTFPs. The dominant facts in NTFPs management are pressure on the area and function of forest, global economic trend, environmental aspect, the livelihood of people around the forest, and institutional aspects. Thus, the shift in the paradigm of forest management (extensification to intensification, partial to holistic), optimization of forest benefits, collaborative management, preparation of a grand design of forest, and network management are expected to become alternative management of NTFPs in the near future. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Engineering research; Timber; Alternative management; Collaborative management; Environmental aspects; Forestry sector; Global economics; Institutional aspects; Non-timber forest products; Timber products; Forestry","Gusmailina; Forest Products Research and Development Centre - Research, Indonesia; email: linagsm@forda-mof.org","Himmi S.K.Kanzaki M.Kono Y.Yusuf S.Agusta A.Semiadi G.Eurwilaichitr L.Hidayat I.Kanti A.Yanto D.H.Y.Watanabe T.","IOP Publishing Ltd",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Box 57, Den Helder, 1780AB, Netherlands","Mangroves of tropical and subtropical shores and deltas contribute to ecosystem functioning and human wellbeing in numerous ways but continue to be lost or degraded worldwide at a rapid pace. Overexploitation driven by poverty is often the root cause of mangrove destruction and degradation. The negative feedback cycle between destruction and poverty can only be broken by justly valuing current or introducing new sustainable livelihood options to foster long-lasting local support for mangroves. The large array of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that mangroves offer have rarely been developed beyond the subsistence level and remain undervalued as “products of the poor”. In light of the global trends towards sustainability and bio-economy, today they represent a major business opportunity for forest communities to produce high value-added end-user products. Even though mangrove NTFPs have been recognized to have high potential toward inclusive development and poverty alleviation and to be highly gender-equal, the development of mangrove NTFPs has continued to attract very little funding or research interest. Several ecological characteristics make commercialization of mangrove NTFPs particularly challenging. Production at economies of scale, including quality standards, as well as marketing and value chain management are all essential in order to develop these products beyond their subsistence role. To be most effective, a systems perspective on NTFP development is needed, whereby product-market development occurs in unison and based on a participative, inclusive and fair development approach. The species/product of choice for value-added product-market development in any specific community or area will depend on several factors. To address many of the typical constraints and maximize the chances of success, we suggest that the use of village or district-level cooperatives may be particularly useful. A better use of the untapped potential of mangroves for local livelihoods may form a most convincing advocate for local protection and restoration of mangrove forests. Therefore, funding agencies, governments and researchers alike are called to invest in mangrove NTFP development as a way to locally incentivize sustainable mangrove protection and restoration. © 2020 by the authors.

Heavy exploration for shoots has nearly resulted in the exhaustion of the natural reserve of this species, but its traditional culture regime largely depends on land use in the long term. In this study, 1-year-old A. elata seedlings were cultured in commercial substrate under a plant factory condition where lighting was supplied by light-emitting diode (LED) panels in two bionic spectra of 16.9% red (R), 77.8% green (G), and 5.4% blue (B) (R2G4B2) and 12.5% R, 84.6% G, and 2.9% B (R2G10B1) to mimic the understory sunlight in natural populations. An artificial spectrum of 26.6% R, 59.9% G, and 13.5% B (R2G1B3) was also involved as the comparison. All LED lighting had a daily photoperiod of 18 h at the photosynthetic photon flux rate of 150 μmol m−2 s−1. Seedlings were fed by exponential fertilization at the rate of 140 mg nitrogen (N) plant−1[N–phosphorus (P)2O5–potassium (K)2O, 9–30–20]. Shoots were harvested twice with a midway cutting. The R2G10B1 spectrum promoted concentrations of N, P, starch, and total saponins in the secondly harvested shoots, where the R2G4B2 spectrum enhanced stem length, fresh weight, N content, and total saponin content per sprouted shoot. Total flavonoid content had a positive correlation with weight and contents of N, P and sugars, but the positive correlation of total saponins was only with weight. The drastic decline of sprout density in the second harvest decreased the content of total saponins in grouped A. elata seedlings. We conclude that light spectra and shoot cutting had a combined effect on biomass accumulation and total saponins which can be promoted in shoot-cut A. elata seedlings in the R2G4B2 spectrum under plant factory condition. © 2020, Franciszek Górski Institute of Plant Physiology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Kraków.","Anthropogenic activity; Cilongya; Longyacongmu; Montane resource; Non-wood forest product (NWFP); Nutrient loading",,"He, X.; Key Laboratory of Wetland Ecology & Environment, China; email: hexingyuan@iga.ac.cn",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",01375881,,APPLD,,"English","Acta Physiol.

Thus, this research seeks to determine the role played by NTFPs at the household level. A survey was conducted with 212 households in four localities with a high degree of marginalization, located on the South Pacific coast of Mexico in Oaxaca State. The results show that, firstly, NTFPs are used by all households, even the wealthiest families, and that the most important products used are fuelwood and medicinal plants. Secondly, the findings indicate that the collection and self-consumption of fuelwood and medicinal plants by households with lower incomes generate savings of at least 20% of their total annual gross income. Thirdly, for the majority of the surveyed households (90%), NTFPs are perceived as important for their well-being. This could be due to traditional or cultural attachment to ancestral practices, such as the use of fuelwood for cooking traditional food and the collection of medicinal plants. Finally, NTFP use is a livelihood diversification strategy and promotes the objective and subjective well-being of rural households. Social and environmental policies need to consider the potential of NTFPs for poverty alleviation and rural development through sustainable use and coordinated actions. HIGHLIGHTS The cultural value of NTFPs is part of people's perception of well-being are complementary measures of NTFP importance in rural households. NTFP use is a livelihood diversification strategy in rural households. Savings derived from the consumption of NTFPs are largest for poorest families. Recognizing wildlife and forest values is important for social and conservation policies. © 2020 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

SUMMARY Trade-in Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) in the Congo Basin is a source of cash income for stakeholders in their value chains, from harvesters to traders. However, gender-disaggregated data on the benefits of such trade in Gabon remains poorly captured and used by policymakers, despite a decree on women's empowerment enacted by the Republic of Gabon in 2017. This study assesses gender dynamics, reasons for entering the trade, economics, and perceived threats to Coula edulis, Dacryodes buettneri, and Irvingia gabonensis value chains originating in Makokou, Gabon. Data from field observations, key informants, and 79 semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in three markets showed that activities in the value chains of these three NTFPs were highly gender-differentiated. Women dominate in all three chains, particularly in the two lower-value products. This was driven by women's vulnerability and men's preference for higher-value timber and NTFPs. Both men and women enter the trade mostly because they lack other ways to generate income and employment. The men involved in the chains tended to harvest slightly larger volumes and sell at higher prices. The NTFPs and their value chains were all perceived as threatened by climate change, deforestation, and unsustainable forest resources management, with both men and women aware of these threats. The importance of the NTFP trade for women suggested that policies and gender focus interventions, for example on domestication, cultivation, value-adding to improve and sustain their income, could contribute to more sustainable value chains and livelihoods. © 2020 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

The average annual value of these collected berry species is estimated to be worth more than EUR 86 million at 2018 prices. The data concerning the collection and use of forest fruits have been systematically collected in a highly detailed structure since 2008, which enables the application of the advanced statistical methods used in this paper. The results of the analyses inter alia demonstrate that collecting forest berries is not only an important recreational activity, but it has an important economic effect. Therefore, this article also deals with the collection of forest fruits, especially bilberries, as a potentially important non-wood forest product (NWFP) for sustainable forest management and also analyses the external factors influencing the total annual amount of collected forest berries. A deeper knowledge of the customer and his or her behaviour- customer insight-are prerequisites for the proactive management of forest ecosystems. The first step to “berry picker insight” is to learn more about the demand, its structure and factors which influence this demand. Thus, one of the research questions concentrates on the analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics of the berry picker that are relevant for explaining the amount of collected forest berries in the Czech Republic. Knowledge of these factors can contribute to a more effective application of marketing methods for shaping and influencing the demand so that, in terms of time and place, it is more in line with the supply, which is limited by the natural conditions, growing season and production potential of forest ecosystems. © 2020 by the authors.","Customer insight; Czech republic; Ecosystem services; Forest berries; Socio-economic importance","Ecosystems; Factor analysis; Fruits; Natural conditions; Non-wood forest products; Proactive management; Recreational activities; Research questions; Socio-demographic characteristics; Sustainable forest management; Vaccinium myrtillus; Forestry; ecosystem service; forest management; forest resource; growing season; nontimber forest product; resource economy; socioeconomic conditions; Analysis Of Variance; Berries; Czech; Demand; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fruits; Sustainable Forest Management; Czech Republic; Rubus fruticosus; Rubus idaeus; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","Palátová, P.; Faculty of Forestry and Wood Sciences, Kamýcká 129, 6-Suchdol, Czech Republic; email: palatovap@fld.czu.cz",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094218663

To stem the erosion of the indigenous practices and instead stimulate, preserve, or improve their use, this study determines the socioeconomic factors that drive the household's use of the practices in the management and conservation of plant species of non-wood forest products (NWFPs). The study was carried out in Nigeria derived savannah. Data was collected from 200 randomly selected households in 10 randomly selected forest communities. Multivariate probit model was used to estimate the socioeconomic factors that influence the simultaneous use of indigenous forest management practices by households. Given multiple use of the practices, the result shows that the indigenous forest management practices used by the households are selective weeding (82.98%), controlled harvesting (82.45%), enrichment planting (75.53%), fire breaks (76.06%) and indigenous protective mechanism (45.74%). The majority (71.28%) of the respondents said they managed bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis and wombulu) using the practices, while the lowest proportion (21.28%) managed bush buck (Gongronema latifolium). The result of the multivariate probit model shows that virtually all the indigenous forest management practices are positively and significantly associated and are thus, complements. However, local protective mechanisms and controlled harvesting, local protective mechanisms and selective weeding, and local protective mechanisms and enrichment planting are not significantly associated. Farming occupation significantly increases the likelihood of simultaneous use of controlled harvesting, enrichment planting, and fire breaks as indigenous forest management practices in the management and conservation of NWFP. On the other hand, age significantly reduces the likelihood of the use of controlled harvesting and selective weeding. The study recommends the provision of support for young people who are more likely to be involved in the indigenous forest management practices; support to farmers who simultaneously use the practices, for example, through the provision of credit facilities; and a proper definition of user rights in community forests. © 2020 The Authors","Agricultural economics; Agricultural science; Derived savannah; Ecology; Economics; Environmental economics; Environmental management; Forest management and conservation; Indigenous practices; Non-wood forest products; Sociology",,"Chukwuone, N.A.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Nigeria; email: nnaemeka.chukwuone@unn.edu.ng",,"Elsevier Ltd",24058440,,,,"English","Heliyon",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094563775

Considering this, the present study has been undertaken in the Himachal Pradesh state in north India. It aims to provide detailed information on diversity, distribution, use pattern, and conservation status of selected NTFPs that have market potential, and suggest a possible way for their sustained management and possible role in livelihood upgradation of dependent communities. Methodology: An inventory of NTFP species was prepared by collecting secondary information from published scientific studies in journals, books, and other periodicals as well as species being traded as per Forest department records. Search on various online databases were also used (Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, ISI Web of Science) using specific search terms such as ""non-timber forest products,""""NTFPs,""""medicinal plants,""""wild edible plants,""and ""Himachal Pradesh,""""Western Himalaya,""and ""Northwest Himalaya.""A list of potential NTFPs was prepared having market value. To evaluate the relative usefulness of different species, a quantitative valuation was also used by calculating various indices, such as use value (UV), relative frequency of citation (RFC), relative importance index (RI), cultural importance index (CI), and cultural value (CV). Results: A total of 811 species have been screened that has significant potential for the State, and categorized in 18 groups as per their use. The family use value was highest for Asteraceae (FUV = 76.75). Among plant parts used, whole plants, roots (including rhizomes and tubers), leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, stems, and barks were used by the forest dwellers. Maximum NTFPs were collected from the warm temperate zone, followed by the temperate, sub-alpine, sub-tropical, and alpine zones. Sixty-one percent of species had medicinal importance, followed by species used for food and fodder purposes. Although species richness of medicinal plants decreased with altitude, however, most plants extracted from high altitudes were high-value species fetching better income. As many as 125 NTFPs were identified under the diverse level of threats according to IUCN criteria and as per the local stakeholders' perceptions. Conclusion: High dependence on NTFPs by poor and marginal communities for domestic needs as well as market demand of selected species leads to create excessive pressure on them. Unfortunately, the state agencies are not having any robust conservation plan for NTFPs. For long-term management of NTFPs sector, a species-specific conservation strategy, proper harvesting protocol, cultivation practices, the supply of quality planting material, product development and diversification, value chain development, and ensured market is greatly desired. This will not only lead to conserving NTFPs resources in their natural habitats but also lead a sustainable livelihood generation for forest dwellers. © 2020 The Author(s).","Conservation status; Distribution; Diversity; Himachal Pradesh; Livelihoods; NTFPs; Threat categorization; Use pattern; Western Himalaya","altitude; animal food; Asteraceae; cultural value; edible plant; flower; forest; fruit; habitat; Himachal Pradesh; human; International Union for Conservation of Nature; medicinal plant; Medline; nonhuman; perception; plant leaf; plant root; plant seed; plant stem; product development; quantitative analysis; review; rhizome; Scopus; species richness; systematic review; Web of Science; cultural anthropology; edible plant; environmental protection; ethnobotany; India; medicinal plant; Conservation of Natural Resources; Culture; Ethnobotany; Forests; India; Plants, Edible; Plants, Medicinal","Sundriyal, R.C.; G.B.

The aim of the research was to study the adaptability of A. ganitrus on degraded land of community forests in Tasikmalaya. Plot establishment was conducted in Gunungtandala Village, Kawalu Sub District and Tasikmalaya District, West Java Province. The spacing of this trial is 3 3 m with 2300 number of seedlings. The research showed that the survival of A. ganitrus in the total area reached 70.6%. The percentage of A. ganitrus life starting from the largest is 98% on flat land, 96% on slope land and 18% on steep land. Survival and growth prove that A. ganitrus are able to grow in this site. The slope factor greatly affects the vegetative and generative growth of E. ganitrus. There is a tendency that he stressed vegetative growth of E. ganitrus on steep land encourages generative growth with the appearance of flowers. Most of the E. ganitrus plants start flowering at the age of 3.5 years. The recommendation of this study is the use of A. ganitrus species in NTFP development on marginal lands in community forests.

Despite these results, questions remain as to whether the valorisation of NTFPs can sustainably contribute to the improvement of the livelihood assets of the extractors. This study therefore evaluated the contribution of NTFP valorisation to the livelihood assets of local people around the northern periphery of the Dja Faunal Reserve (DFR), East Cameroon. To achieve this objective, data collected from 215 households in 32 villages were analyzed using factor analysis, Mann-Whitney U tests, and structural equation modelling. The results suggest that NTFP valorisation significantly contributes to the livelihood assets of local people at the periphery of the DFR. However, NTFP revenue was not significant in predicting their livelihood assets. Moreover, the local conservation management practices were not significant in predicting the livelihood assets in the long run. The results also revealed that individuals who received training and capacity building on good practices such as efficient collection techniques, effective drying techniques, and good conservation techniques earned better revenues and the impact on their livelihood was more significant than for those who did not. These results therefore recommend that the way forward for NTFP valorisation lies at the level of improving its quality and the market. © 2020 by the authors.","Cameroon; Conservation management practices; Dja Faunal reserve; Livelihood; NTFP valorisation; Revenue","Historic preservation; Timber; Tropics; Capacity building; Drying technique; Good practices; Local conservation; Mann-Whitney U test; Non-timber forest products; Structural equation modelling; Tropical zones; Forestry; capacity building; conservation management; livelihood; local planning; nontimber forest product; training; valorization; Cameroon; Capacity; Conservation; Extractors; Forestry; Impact; Techniques; Tropics; Cameroon; Dja Biosphere Reserve","Epanda, M.A.; African Wildlife Foundation, P.O Box 5333, Cameroon; email: mepanda@awf.org",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092525822

Therefore, the objective of this work was to carry out a collection of publications on NTFPs in Brazil, until 2019, available in the Scopus database, presenting a bibliometric review and the state of the art of this theme from the evaluation of these publications, discussing the challenges of Brazilian legislation on NTFPs. After screening the articles of interest, 196 documents were evaluated, in which they were observed institutions and authors, analyzing networks of citations and terms used, areas of forest sciences and sciences that encompass the most explored biomes and the most studied species. The results showed that the concern to research on NTFPs in Brazil began in the 1990s, with an increase in the number of publications over the years. Besides that, the research on NTFPs is multidisciplinary, with emphasis on the areas of Agricultural and Biological Sciences and Environmental Science. For better regulation of the process of exploration and management of NTFPs in Brazil, the need to create specific legislation that takes into account factors such as the phytogeographic domain the explored area, producing species, and the products and co-products obtained was observed. © 2020 by the authors.","Environmental legislation; Extractivism; Forest management; Forest production; Forest products market; Natural products","bibliography; database; forestry production; literature review; nontimber forest product; phytogeography; planning legislation; publishing; World Wide Web; Brazil; Scopus","Silva, T.C.; Department of Forestry Engineering and Technology, Brazil; email: thiago.cardoso@ufpr.br",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090380712

A large number of rural people in India are dependent on NTFPs for fulfilment of their basic needs. Accordingly, this study assessed the role of various NTFPs, their commercial behaviour and future potential. In particular, this article assesses the contribution of NTFPs to the enhancement of livelihoods of Santal tribes of the Paschim Medinipur district of India and examines the commercialization pattern vis-a-vis highlighting the suitable management strategies. Ethno-botanical data, household survey from the forest dwellers and market survey were the primary data sources, used in this research. The use value of different species was calculated to determine the multipurpose use, as well as the importance of various NTFPs. The method of collection, marketization, and economic value of various NTFPs was determined through participatory appraisal techniques and market survey. The market channel, net return, and price spread modelling were adopted to determine the commercialization patterns of NTFPs. Multiple regression models were run to determine the price and marketization factors of NTFPs. It was observed that tribal dwellers are selling their products to local agents or intermediaries due to a lack of knowledge of value additionality, lack of restoration potentiality and lack of access to market. Consequently the price spread of the NTFPs is higher in metropolitan and global markets than in the local markets Participatory community-based development strategies can be used achieve maximum benefits from NTFPs for local communities. © 2020, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Commercialization potential; Multiple regression model; Price spread analysis; Santal livelihoods; Use value of NTFPs","basic needs; commercialization; income; livelihood; multiple regression; nontimber forest product; price determination; rural economy; India; West Bengal; West Midnapore","Dinda, S.; Department of Geography and Environment Management, India; email: santanudinda2012@gmail.com",,"Springer",18737617,,,,"English","Small-scale For.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084463855

Despite its ecological and socioeconomic importance, little is known about the environmental factors determining its geographic distribution. The main goals of this study were to investigate the influence of climatic and environmental factors on the geographic distribution of S. coronata and to evaluate the conservation status within its potential distribution area. We modeled the fundamental niche of S. coronata using the MaxEnt algorithm and assessed the degree of vulnerability of environmental suitability areas quantifying the representativeness of protected areas and the different land use and land cover classes. Results predicted that the distribution of S. coronata is determined mainly by seasonality of precipitation and precipitation of the coldest quarter of the year. The areas of suitability, despite their large geographical extent, showed a high degree of environmental vulnerability, mainly due to the high conversion rate of native vegetation areas into agriculture and livestock and the low representation of protected areas. The results indicate a low effectiveness of the system of conservation units to protect the species, with anthropogenic disturbances threatening the quality of habitats and the persistence of S. coronata populations. Results can be used to support actions for the conservation and management of S. coronata, as well as decision making on the design of protected areas. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Arecaceae; Conservation and sustainable management; Non-Timber Forest Products - NTFP; Protection effectiveness; Species distribution models-sdms","algorithm; anthropogenic effect; conservation status; deciduous tree; decision making; land cover; land use change; persistence; protected area; seasonality; software; vulnerability; Brazil; Arecaceae; Syagrus coronata","Scariot, A.; Embrapa Recursos Genéticos e Biotecnologia, Caixa Postal 02372, Brazil; email: aldicir.scariot@embrapa.br",,"Elsevier GmbH",03672530,,FLRAB,,"English","Flora Morphol.

This research, therefore, seeks to fill a gap in understanding of the contribution of NTFPs to the livelihoods of forest-dependent people in Vietnam. Structured interviews were held with 100 households in three villages in Truong Son commune, Luong Son district, Hoa Binh Province, Vietnam with different types of household wealth ranking. The indirect opportunity cost (IOC) method was applied to provide an indirect estimate of the economic value of NTFP extraction by households. This research showed that NTFPs contribute moderately to livelihoods of all forest-dependent people in Vietnam, but that NTFPs are a more important livelihood source for poor households than for moderate and rich households. Significant determinants of a household’s dependence on NTFPs are the number of adults, other types of cash income (e.g. off-farm cash income, animal husbandry cash income, other forest activities cash income, pension, and salaries).

We contribute to clarify this nuance, by analyzing the well-being outcomes linked to forest and non-forest diversification choices, through a systematic sample of 200 households around the Kilum-Ijim Forest Landscape (KIFL) of Cameroon. A composite household well-being index based on the Human Development Index approach, and the ordinary least square were used to estimate the effect of livelihood diversification on well-being. However, we first identified the determinants of livelihood diversification choices using the logit model. The results show that most households (84%) rely on forest-dependent livelihood activities, with varying consequences on conservation. High return diversification activities are important for household well-being. If not well managed, promoting forest-dependent activities may potentially threaten conservation. This can be mitigated by revising Cameroon’s forest policy to reduce forest-dependent diversification, promote NTFP domestication, and establish mutually-agreed forest use quotas for communities. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cameroon; diversification choices; forest communities; forest policy; well-being","forestry policy; human development index; livelihood; logit analysis; policy approach; quality of life; Cameroon","Kimengsi, J.N.; Institute for Tropical Forestry and Forest Products, Germany; email: jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de",,"Routledge",08941920,,,,"English","Soc.

It discusses and analyzes Simone Corbiau’s archaeological expedition to North-West Frontier Province and the Malakand Political Agency in 1938. Corbiau was a Belgian archaeologist having interest in pre-/protohistoric terracottas. In the first place, we give a scholarly background to her research so as to understand the importance of the work. In the early 1930s, D.H. Gordon published some terracotta objects from the then NWFP and Corbiau’s disagreement with him about dating the materials brought her into India in 1936. She did fieldwork and its results were immediately published. Corbiau visited India for the second time in 1938 but her expedition this time could not meet success. She made an unsuccessful attempt to work at Malakand and Swat, in addition to Peshawar, Mardan and Swabi, and it is this obscured story in the history of the area’s archaeology that this paper entirely deals with. We argue that despite the desperate support provided by the Archaeological Survey of India to the party, colonial geostrategic politics coupled with some inherent operational shortcomings in the project doomed it to failure. © 2020 The British Association for South Asian Studies.","ASI; Cobb; Corbiau; Malakand; Swat",,"Shaheen, I.; Department of History, Pakistan; email: ifqatmahr@gmail.com",,"Routledge",02666030,,,,"English","South Asian Stud.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091346441

Here we assess the status and use of the globally important, threatened walnut-fruit forests of Dashtijum Nature Reserve, Tajikistan. We use a mixed methods approach combining a semi-structured interview based socio-economic survey with statistical analysis. Thirty-three tree species were recorded, with Rosaceae the most common family. The mean basal area of the forest was 20.8 m2per ha and most tree species exhibited stable population structures. Resource use was prevalent throughout the community; most households harvested at least one fruit or nut species (78%), firewood (88%) and grazed livestock (85%). Most respondents noted declines in availability of fruits, nuts and firewood and reported a decrease in the overall area and quality of grazing. Statistical analysis and machine learning identified that distance to nearest settlement significantly affected forest total basal area, tree species richness and the Shannon index, a metric of diversity sensitive to rare species. Our results suggest that conservation management by the government and NGOs is partly effective but there is a need for increased enforcement of grazing restrictions, to prevent further forest degradation. © 2020 Cambridge University Press.

We systematically reviewed the empirical evidence of relationships between three ecosystem services: carbon stock and sequestration, timber provisioning and non-timber forest product (NTFP) provisioning, and three dimensions of plant diversity: taxonomic, functional and structural. We carried out meta-analyses to assess their validity across spatial scales and plot sizes. We found that indicators of all three dimensions of plant diversity have reported relationships with at least two of the studied ecosystem services, but there has been limited and inconsistent use of plant diversity indicators and little attention for relationships with timber and NTFP services. Nevertheless, we found that tree species richness showed robust significant positive correlations with carbon stock across the tropics, and that the geographical extent of the study area had a significant negative effect on the strength of this relationship, where the strength of the relationship decreased with increasing geographical extent. This paper reveals a knowledge gap for services other than carbon stock and shows that at local to regional spatial scales, synergies can be achieved between policies focused on biodiversity conservation and maintenance of carbon stocks. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon stock; Conservation policies; Meta-analysis; Non-timber forest products; Systematic review; Timber",,"Steur, G.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Netherlands; email: g.steur@uu.nl",,"Elsevier B.V.",22120416,,,,"English","Ecosyst.

The fruits of Irvingiaceae trees, commonly known as “bush mangoes” or “mangues sauvages,” are crucial foods for Central African human populations, as well as local wildlife. Irvingiaceae oil-rich kernels play an important role in local diet, well-being, and livelihood. When collected for sale, they enter the international market of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), which represents a considerable source of income for central African countries. Despite the importance of bush mangoes, there is a general lack of precision in the literature on the exact species of Irvingiaceae present in local diets and NTFP markets. Few botanical studies include local names and uses of the different Irvingiaceae species, while ethnographical and social studies rarely corroborate their identifications by collecting vouchers. In this study, we combined ethnographic research and botanical collection to verify which Irvingiaceae species were consumed and collected for trade by the Baka, a group of forager-horticulturalists in southeastern Cameroon. We provide evidence of the floristic diversity hidden behind the term “bush mangoes”, as well as the knowledge and uses of Irvingiaceae fruits by the Baka. We discuss the importance of eight Irvingiaceae species for Baka livelihood as well as the potential threats regarding the future of these valuable trees. © 2020, The Author(s).","Baka; Cameroon; Desbordesia; Irvingia; Klainedoxa; Mangues sauvages; NTFP; Wild edible plants",,"Gallois, S.; Faculty of Archaeology, Netherlands; email: galloissandrine.ethnoeco@gmail.com",,"Springer",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

It is difficult to grow everywhere due to the specific environmental conditions under which it grows on the wild. Optimal cultivation condition and biosynthetic level of organosulfur compounds through forest cultivation of wild garlic were determined in five experimental forest sites. The survival rate of transplanted wild garlic seedlings was 73.3% in the S1 site (Chamaecyparis obtusa dominant forest) but was as lower as 40% in Acer palmatum dominant forest and bare ground. During 3 years after seedling transplantation, the growth of wild garlic was high in Chamaecyparis obtusa dominant forest (S1) and Pinus koraiensis dominant forest (S5) compared to the other three sites. The soil physicochemical properties of these five sites are quite different from those of the major wild garlic producing areas in Korea. Organosulfur compounds, the main bioactive substance of wild garlic, consist of disulfide, methyl 2-propenyl, disulfide, methyl 1-propenyl, dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, tetrasulfide, and trisulfide. These compounds were significantly different in each site, and the organic sulfur compound contents in P. koraiensis rain forest (S5) were 92.6% in the first year and 81.7% in the third year and decreased with plant growth. The growth of wild garlic was correlated with soil physicochemical properties, for example, available phosphate and calcium. Likewise, the concentration of soil minerals was correlated with the growth of plant and bulb of wild garlic. The results of the study will contribute improving the efficiency of the forest land with the cultivation of useful non-timer forest products. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Cultivation under forest; Non-timer forest product (NTFP); Organosulfur compounds; Soil physicochemical properties; Wild garlic","agricultural land; coniferous tree; cultivation; environmental conditions; forest ecosystem; growth; leafy vegetable; nontimber forest product; physicochemical property; soil nutrient; Acer palmatum; Allium ursinum; Allium victorialis var. platyphyllum; Chamaecyparis obtusa; Pinus koraiensis","Choi, M.S.; Division of Environmental Forest Science, South Korea; email: mschoi@gnu.ac.kr",,"Springer",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

This calls for the assessment of the current status and future trajectories of their populations. Using population data collected from three land-use types (e.g., grazing lands, riverine areas and natural forest) in western Tigray, we evaluated the vulnerability of the multipurpose baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) to human disturbances and climate change. The study was based on the premises that integrating ecological science with modeling tools and local knowledge would enhance the overall effectiveness of conservation strategies and community support. Therefore, based on field-based inventory, ecological niche modeling and a socioeconomic study, we characterized and mapped baobab current and future population distribution and documented local knowledge on the uses and management of the species. The characterization of the population structure showed that baobab stands were denser with larger-sized and taller trees in riverine areas and natural forest compared to grazing lands, suggesting adverse effects of human disturbances on its populations. Moreover, positively skewed size-class distributions with negative slopes in all land-use types indicated a low recruitment of juvenile trees to the adult stage. Climate change simulations using Maximum Entropy Algorithm (Maxent) revealed that future temperature increases would lead to significant reductions (41–100%) in baobab suitable habitats due to range contraction. The intensive harvesting of baobab leaves, branches and bark and lack of conversation practices as indicated by local communities, in combination with the risk of local extinction under future climate warming constitute serious threats for the viability of the species in western Tigray. The results suggest immediate interventions, such as planting baobab at up to 65 m higher in altitude, designing appropriate leaf and bark harvest strategies and protecting seedlings from livestock, will help guarantee the persistence of the species populations. © 2020 The Authors","Consensus value; Local ecological knowledge; Maximum entropy (Maxent); Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Overgrazing; Size-class distribution",,"Noulèkoun, F.; Division of Environmental Science and Ecological Engineering, 145 Anam-Ro, South Korea; email: bigflo@korea.ac.kr",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

Three species of this genus, i.e. D. draco (Willd.) Blume, D. didymophilla and D. Micracantha, are highly value commodity due to their larger fruits and longer fructescences. Dragon's blood has been known in the traditional ancient Chinese medicines as haemostatic agent, antidiarrheal, antiulcer, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory. Particularly the dracorhodin, a valuable bioactive substance, is closely associated with antitumour and wound healing activity and other industrial need. The distribution of Daemonorops is limited to Malaysia, Thailand and western Indonesia, especially in Sumatra. Harvesting D. draco seeds has been served as traditional livelihood for some local tribes and farmers in Aceh Province. Resin extracted from Aceh jernang is classified as excellent due to higher content of dracorhodin, but its processing method is still conducted in a very traditional way. The forests in Aceh are suitable for jernang to thrive, but jernang population is decreasing due to deforestation and inappropriate harvesting. Unless conservation efforts are done, jernang might extinct in the near future. Over the past few years, some local farmers have realized the importance of jernang in their livelihoods, and hence they take part in the conservation.

Yet, little is known of their trade status in Nepal. This research was carried out to unfold the status of pangolin trade in Sankhuwasava District of Nepal. We used mixed methods such as semi-structured questionnaire (n=75) and, focus group discussion (n=4) and key Informant Interview, (n=30) to assess the trade status. Seizure data (2009-2017) were gathered from law enforcement agencies to predict major trade routes. The major threat perceived was hunting especially by unemployed local youth and children. The majority of hunters were opportunistic. Sankhuwasava District has become both source and transit for the illegal pangolin trade rather than for local use. The involvement of non-timber forest product traders was high in the illegal trade business, however, there seems a rapid decline in the seizure of pangolin in the last two years, mainly because of the deployment of the Nepal army in the Makalu Barun National Park, which had long served as a major route to China. Thus, we recommend continuation of strong border security. Our study calls for capacity building of enforcement agencies for detailed investigation of seizure data. For sustainable conservation of pangolin and its habitat we recommend sustained conservation awareness programs in addition to alternative livelihood opportunity. Furthermore, formation of community based anti-poaching units followed by motivation, anti-poaching trainings, security assurance, and incentives for worthy conservation outcomes in pangolin-rich communities might aid in conservation. © Ghimire et al. 2020.","Chinese pangolin; Illegal hunting; Indian pangolin; Manis crassicaudata; Manis pentadactyla; NTFP traders; Opportunistic hunting; Sankhuwasava district; Transboundary",,"Ghimire, P.; Faculty of Forestry, Nepal; email: prayash.pg@gmail.com",,"Wildlife Information Liaison Development Society",09747893,,,,"English","J.

Globalisation poses challenges to rural areas given technological advances and intensified competition in agricultural markets, ageing rural populations and expansion of urban areas. However, in recent years, the conception of rural areas has shifted from places of production to places of consumption. In line with an increasing urban demand for consumption of products and services close to nature within the rural landscape, we observe the emergence of experiential offers based around non-wood forest products (NWFP) where the consumer is closely connected to the harvesting and use of the products. In this paper, we examine how such intersecting demands have created new forms of market for NWFP, by analysing in-depth four innovative examples in Austria and the United Kingdom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the managers of these businesses, and cases were analysed through application of both the experience economy and the innovation systems approach. We found that all four businesses were on the one hand derived from traditional, regional cultural skills and values and, on the other hand, directly connected to new consumers’ demands. The apparent success of these emerging business models lies in the accretion of new social values onto traditional products. Thus creative approaches blending offers designed to enhance cosumers’ experiences into traditional sectors, such as forestry, would have potential in the future. However, our results indicate that there is a lack of institutional support for the development of such businesses in both countries. Better suited innovation policies and support structures would be important for mainstreaming or encouraging the development of similar businesses, innovations and knowledge. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Entrepreneurship; Experience economy; Innovation system; Non-wood forest products (NWFP); Services; Traditional rural crafts; Value creation","entrepreneur; forest product; globalization; innovation; rural area; rural economy","Živojinović, I.; Institute of Forest, Forest Policy Research Network Feistmantelstrasse 4, Austria; email: ivana.zivojinovic@boku.ac.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078996189

While the broad contours of this transition have been observed and studied previously, there have been few attempts to characterize it using quantitative, qualitative, or geospatial methods. Here, we combine a novel remote sensing-based method with qualitative social science research to understand the emergence of social forestry and its implications for land use/land cover change associated with implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in the Western Cascades of Oregon. We linked time-series satellite data with forest inventory data to track patterns of timber harvest at scales commensurate with timber management decision-making. We then compared these patterns to policy-based expectations. We found a significant disconnect between NWFP policy and actual timber harvest patterns, raising questions about the effectiveness of the NWFP land use allocation system and the 'land sparing' approach to managing tensions between conservation and production. Qualitative research, including semi-structured interviews with federal agency personnel and local stakeholders, shed light on the causal mechanisms and reciprocal relationships driving spatial patterns of timber harvesting, which we discuss in terms of the emergence of social forestry involving complex, place-based negotiations between the federal government and local veto actors advocating for conservation. Findings have implications for US Forest Service public engagement strategies and efforts to establish zones of agreement regarding timber harvesting, as well as broader discussions about the agency's future. © 2020 The Author(s).

Compared with other forest products, few studies have investigated the governance of NWFPs in European post-socialistic countries transitioning from a planned to a market economy. This study compares institutional frameworks and stakeholder arrangements related to NWFPs in Russia and Ukraine using a case study approach. Both countries have a legacy of top-down forest government, state-owned forests, and rural communities with a long dependence on plant- and animal-based NWFPs. We analysed legal documents for NWFPs in each country and conducted expert interviews with stakeholders from the public, private, and civil sectors involved in the decision-making process of NWFPs. Institutional frameworks for NWFPs in both countries are complex, unclear, and overlap. Multiple legal documents contain restrictions regarding the extraction and sustainability of NWFPs. However, no special laws or policies are solely for NWFPs; all measures are included in legislation that regulates nature conservation and forest management. The government of both countries tends to overlook non-industrial forest use undertaken by marginal local communities, even if economic, social, and cultural values of NWFPs are relatively high for local and regional development. A misfit is observed between legal frameworks and forest companies’ business policies with customary rights. This phenomenon caused a shift to introduce new stakeholder arrangements related to NWFPs as a special type of resource in areas where NWFPs are heavily used both for subsistence and for generating household income by local communities. Landscape approach initiatives such as model forests and biosphere reserves may empower local communities to find means to protect their rights, needs, interests, and values related to NWFPs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Forest governance; Kortkeros (Russian Federation); Non-wood forest products; Roztochya (Ukraine); Rural areas; Sustainable forest management","decision making; empowerment; forest management; governance approach; institutional framework; local participation; nontimber forest product; participatory approach; rural area; stakeholder; sustainable forestry; top-down approach; Russian Federation; Ukraine; Animalia","Stryamets, N.; Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, Via Torino 155, Italy; email: natastr@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077172580

In Sicily, the use of wild plants in the human diet dates back to very ancient times and still plays an important role in some rural communities. Moreover, in this regard, the natural and cultural inheritance of this island is wealthy and diversified for several reasons. First, Sicily hosts a rich vascular flora, with 3,000 native and 350 endemic plants. Second, due to its central position in the Mediterranean, the island has acted as a veritable melting pot for the ethnobotanical knowledge of the rural communities of the entire basin. We reviewed all the available literature and, starting from such omnicomprehensive checklist, partially improved thanks to the data issuing from recent field investigations, we critically revised the whole species list, basing our review on field data issuing from interviews and on our expert knowledge. As a result, we provide a substantially updated list of 292 NWFP growing on the island. Further 34 species, reported as NWFP on previous papers were discarded because they are not native to Sicily, while 45 species were listed separately because their identity, occurrence and local use as food is doubtful and needs to be further investigated. Moreover, we tried to shed light on the ecology (growth form and preferential habitat) of the Sicilian NWFP, with special focus on crop wild relatives (CWR). Our preliminary ecological analyses point out that a high percentage of these plants are linked with the so-called ‘cultural’ landscapes, patchy semi-natural environments rich in ecotones, leading to the conclusion that the maintenance of century-old agro-pastoral practices may represent an effective way to preserve the local heritage of edible plants. Our study allowed to identify as much as 102 taxa of agronomic interest which could be tested as novel crops in order to face ongoing global changes and to comply with sustainable agriculture policies. Among them, 39 taxa show promising traits in terms of tolerance to one or more environmental stress factors, while 55 more are considered CWR and/or can be easily cultivated and/or show high productivity/yield potential. © Copyright © 2020 Pasta, La Rosa, Garfì, Marcenò, Gristina, Carimi and Guarino.","agro-pastoral landscapes; Ellenberg Indicator Values (EIV); ethnobotany; sustainable agriculture; TEK (traditional environmental knowledge)",,"Carimi, F.; Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources (IBBR), Italy; email: francesco.carimi@ibbr.cnr.it",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",1664462X,,,,"English","Front.

Currently, techniques to domesticate NTFPs under agroforestry systems have been explored, with two examples of economically valuable NTFP commodities are Trigona bee (Trigona sp.) and Bambu Tabah (Gigantochloa nigrociliata). Although techniques for its domestication have been identified, not much farmers know and understand how to domesticate the commodities. Government extension services are not yet disseminating information on NTFPs domestication, alternatives extension services approaches need to be explored to widespread information on NTFPs domestication to farmers. Learning centres can be one of the approaches that can support the dissemination of NTFPs domesticaion. This study was conducted to explore potentials of learning centres to support NTFPs production from agroforestry systems. Two case studies were taken, i.e. Trigona in Gunungkidul District and Bambu tabah in Lombok Tengah District. Information was collected to explore the potential adoption level of domestication techniques introduced by the learning centre, through interview with 60 learning centre visitors in Lombok Tengah and 55 in Gunungkidul. The study showed that learning centres increased the adoption potential of the NTFP domestication, particularly through facilities that were given to the community to be tested in their own plot. However, farmer's accessibility to visit the learning centres are still limited. Government supports is needed to enhance farmers' accessibility and development of learning centres as part of their forestry extension services programs for enhancing production of NTFPs as sources for local livelihoods. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Forestry; Information dissemination; Timber; Agroforestry system; Case-studies; Forestry extension; Government supports; Potential adoption; Learning systems","Syarifah, F.A.; World Agroforestry (ICRAF), Jl.

Research on the types of stands that affect tendril production in agroforestry systems is needed. This study aimed to determine anatomical adaptation of ketak at various types of stands and relative light intensity in agroforestry systems. The research method used a randomized block design. There were 2 treatments i.e. the stand type (natural stands, coffee stands, gliricidia stands, and mahogany stands) and Relative Light Intensity (RLI). Each stand consists of 3 blocks with 30 replication plants, making it a total of 90 plants per stand type. We used natural seedling as understory and combined with forestry plants. Number of leaves, plant height, plant number, plant length, tendrils diameter and growth percentage of ketak, and RLI were measured or calculated in each stand type. Variance analysis was used to determine the effect of stand type. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the relationship between stand types or RLI and number of leaves, plant height, plant number, plant length, and tendrils diameter. This study showed that (1). The growth percentage of ketak in natural stand, coffee stand, gliricidia stand, and mahogany stand respectively 62.22%, 97.77%, 75.56%, and 74.44% (2). The stand type with significant differences were found in the total number of leaves (F = 17.441; p = 0.000); plant height (F = 24.065; p = 0.000) and tendril diameter (F = 7.747; p = 0.000), but not in the total number and lengthof tendrils. (3). There were significant differences in stand type and RLI on total number of leaf, plant height, and tendril diameter of ketak plants with value of total number of leaf (F= 15,92, p = 0,00, and R square = 0,08); value of plant height (F = 34,63, p = 0,00, dan R square = 0,0005); and value of tendril diameter (F = 5,62, p = 0,00, dan R square = 0,0034). While in the total number of tendrils and tendrils length of ketak plants were not significant. The conclusion were (1) The highest growth percentage of ketak in Coffee stand is 97.77%. (2) Coffee stand had the highest influence on the total number of leaves, plant height and tendrils diameter. 3. The stand type and RLI only had a relationship with total number of leaf, plant height, and tendril diameter of ketak plants but not with total number of tendrils and tendrils length. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.","agroforestry; Ketak; NTFP; RLI; stand type","Forestry; Linear regression; Timber; Agroforestry system; Block designs; Light intensity; Multiple linear regressions; Plant height; R square; research methods; Variance analysis; Plants (botany)","Wahyuningsih, E.; Forestry Program Study, Jalan Majapahit No.61, Indonesia; email: endahwahyoe_unram@yahoo.co.id",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Nevertheless, the market chain of broom grass in Laos has been poorly documented and described. This study involved 85 semi-structured interviews with collectors or traders of broom grass in three districts of Luang Prabang province, and aims to better understand the market chain of broom grass. Collectors (smallholder farmers and their families) rely on two sources of broom grass: wild material collected from communal lands, and to alesser extent, harvested from their upland fields, with very little broom grass specifically planted as acrop. The collection, processing, and marketing of broom grass involved all members of the household, ranging in age from 4 to 80 years; however, the female members (women and girls) have adominant role, participating in all activities from collection to sale of broom grass. The study has identified key points of the market chain of broom grass where efforts may improve returns to smallholder farmers.

NTFPs are harvested throughout the U.S. for numerous purposes, and those sold in market contribute significantly to household and local economies. While estimates of ESV can aid decision-making related to conservation and management, NTFPs have been generally neglected. We discuss challenges and approaches for prioritizing valuation, quantifying production, measuring costs and benefits, and finding data sources. Many NTFP markets are informal, and market players may have an interest in withholding information. Data about geographic and temporal distribution, production cost, quantity harvested, and price may therefore be limited. In two case studies, we explore the nuances of estimating ESV of forests for medicinal products.

However, trade is still largely informal, and the market scope and structure are not well understood. One exception is American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.). Ginseng's legal status as a threatened species requires that buyers apply for a license and keep sales records that are submitted to a state authority. Other marketable medicinal plants collected from the same forests, known colloquially as 'off-roots', are not similarly tracked. To study the characteristics of off-root trade in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States, registered ginseng buyers in 15 eastern states were surveyed in 2015 and 2016 about business attributes, purchase volume, and harvest distribution for 15 off-root species selected for their economic and conservation value. Buyers voluntarily reported harvesting 47 additional NTFP species. The most frequently purchased off-root species were the roots and rhizomes of two perennial understory plants: black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis L.). Survey data were used to develop a buyer typology and describe the off-root market structure and material sourcing. The buyer typology included four distinct categories: side or specialty (small); seasonal venture (medium); large integrated or dedicated business (large); and dedicated bulk enterprise (regional aggregator). Market activity was mapped across the study area, demonstrating that most off-root trade is concentrated in central Appalachia, an area with extensive forests and a struggling economy. Study methods and data improve non-timber forest product market insights, are useful for forest management, and can support efforts to advance sustainable NTFP supply chains. © 2020 by the authors.","Appalachia; Medicinal plants; Non-timber forest products","Commerce; Conservation; Sales; Supply chains; Surveys; Timber; American ginseng; Conservation values; Market activities; Market structures; Medicinal plants; Non-timber forest products; Panax quinquefolius; Threatened species; Forestry; deciduous forest; forest management; forest product; medicinal plant; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; Commerce; Conservation; Forestry; Forests; Sales; Surveys; United States; United States; Cimicifuga dahurica; Cimicifuga racemosa; Hydrastis canadensis; Panax ginseng; Panax quinquefolius","Kruger, S.D.; Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation, United States; email: skruger@vt.edu",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084550972

We assessed the effects of land use and management upon the distribution of size and on the frequency of life stages of Butia capitata, an intensively harvested fruit palm, endemic to a southeastern portion of the Brazilian Cerrado. Most populations had a reverse-J size-class distribution, indicating good recruitment in the landscape even under fruit harvesting pressure and extensive cattle ranching. Regeneration was null or scarce in areas under more intense land use and management pressure, such as found on large, industrial farms. Soil fertility and texture were associated with seedling frequency, soil texture with sapling frequency, and precipitation with juvenile frequency. These factors must be taken into account for the enrichment, introduction and restoration of populations, actions demanded by traditional populations and family farmers who harvest the valuable fruits of B. capitata. Populations in areas with intense land use and inadequate management practices may be doomed to plummet. In contrast, in areas managed by traditional peoples and family farmers, characterized by low intensity of fruit harvesting and low frequency of cattle, populations should persist. Supporting traditional peoples and family farmers’ livelihoods and promoting changes in the management of areas where the species occurs may contribute to in situ conservation of the Cerrado’s biodiversity in multiple-use landscapes. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Life stage abundance; Management; NTFP; Population structure; Savanna palm ecology","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; cattle; demography; juvenile; land use; population structure; sapling; savanna; seedling; soil fertility; soil texture; Bos; Butia capitata","Scariot, A.; Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação, Caixa Postal 02372, Brazil; email: aldicir.scariot@embrapa.br",,"Springer",09603115,,BONSE,,"English","Biodiversity Conserv.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057142299

Dragon's blood tree resin is one of the commercial NTFPs in Yemen and is produced by tapping Dracaena cinnabari trees, which are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List. By applying a forest resource assessment, the present study inventoried the D. cinnabari forest with the aim of identifying and evaluating its structure, the harvesting status of the resin, and the current management system. The study was conducted in the Firmihin forest, Socotra Island, Yemen Republic. The forest resource assessment was carried out through a forest inventory by measuring trees from 12 plots following stratified random sampling. The relevant parameters of a total of 819 trees were measured, including the tree height, stem height of lowest branches, height of the highest wound, diameter at breast height (DBH), and presence of wounds. The wounds were measured on a total of 401 trees. Value chain analysis (VCA) was used to clarify the flow of dragon's blood tree resin from the producers to the local, national, and international markets. Traditional management was examined using questionnaires in the case study area and surrounding villages. There are two tapping techniques: (1) collecting the pure dragon's blood tree resin and (2) cutting part of the bark along with the pure resin. The second technique resulted in 84% of the trees having wounds. The tappers were mostly from the community in and around the forest. The study found that the traditional management system of tapping dragon's blood tree resin is not sustainable. © 2020 by the author.","Climate change; Harvesting rules; Local community; Tree damage; Wounds","Blood; Computer graphics; International trade; Natural resources; Resins; Surveys; Diameter-at-breast heights; Forest resource assessments; International markets; Management systems; Non-timber forest products; Stratified random sampling; Traditional management; Value chain analysis; Forestry; conservation management; forest dynamics; forest management; forest resource; growth response; resin; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; Blood; Computer Graphics; Foreign Trade; Forestry; Natural Resources; Surveys; Arkhabil Suqutra; Socotra; Yemen; Dracaena cinnabari","Al-Okaishi, A.; Department of Forest Botany, Zemědělská 3, Czech Republic; email: abdulraqeb07@yahoo.com",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086629833

A comprehensive discussion of the subject provides special attention to property, tenancy, public goods and access rights to non-wood forest products (NWFP), seen as forest ecosystem services in a framework for forest management decisions. The overall purpose is to provide a logical argument for transitioning to sustainable management of forests for timber and NWFP. Recent Findings: Multifunctional ecosystem-based approaches are transforming our understanding of forests. The prevailing economic relevance of NWFP for trade and sustenance requires their operative integration into forest management. Integration of NWFP will shift a traditional timber-oriented management paradigm towards an inclusive ecosystem forest management approach. We show that the impact of NWFP resources on livelihoods provides multiple benefits to all sectors of global society. Policy and property rights affect the availability and sustainability of the resource, while regulations, restrictions and prohibitions target the sustainable harvest of NWFP under growing demand. Official reporting of production volumes of NWFP is sparse, erratic or inaccurate due to a complex system that is opaque and with inadequately understood value chains, yet research is underway to better understand all NWFP sectors. Summary: A shift from command-and-control forest management to broader governance schemes is observed, yet despite a growing awareness of their importance, NWFP and their potential for a bio-based economy require more research. A conceptual framework for transitioning to sustainable co-production management of timber and NWFP is presented. Such a transition is needed to ensure long-term forest security, health and resilience. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bio-based economy; Co-production; Food security; Forest governance; Forest-based value chains; Policy; Sustainable forest management",,"Sheppard, J.P.; Chair of Forest Growth, Tennenbacher Str 4, Germany; email: jonathan.sheppard@iww.uni-freiburg.de",,"Springer",21986436,,,,"English","Curr.

Based on total fruit produced annually per hectare and the market price of each species, the economic value of each species in terms of the fruit produced was calculated and depicted. Results showed that the distribution area of fruit-providing species was about 10 percent (684 ha) of the studied forest area. In total, the annual sustainable production of all species was 52.6 thousand kilograms. The economic value varied from USD 6 to USD 983 per ha in different areas. The revenue of collected fruit-providing species varied from USD 0.9 to USD 14,903 per year for all involved households. The average contribution of NWFP income to household income was 21 percent. The collection of NWFPs had a negative correlation with the education of the household head, opportunity cost, and household wealth; on the other hand, NWFP collection had a positive relation with fruit price and yield. Forest management strategies can focus on the areas with the highest economic value. This research can help inform decision-makers regarding the selection of eligible forest areas for conservation and enforcement of regulations. © 2019, The New York Botanical Garden.","Annual sustainable production; economic value map; ethnobotany; forest management strategies; fruit-providing species",,"Ghanbari, S.; Department of Forestry, Iran; email: ghanbarisajad@gmail.com",,"Springer",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

We reviewed 72 papers that bring on board both social and ecological dimensions of NTFP use and/or commercialization, while identifying different dimensions of sustainability. We found that the majority (68%) of research does not encompass the socio-cultural dimension, and sense of place is not addressed in the papers we analyzed. Additionally, we found that many studies (~92%) have not conducted a multi-scalar analysis, which we deem crucial for the thorough understanding of sustainability. Because ecological unsustainability is prevalent among the papers analyzed, we bring on board the discussion around why certain social-ecological interactions and dynamics result in positive outcomes in both human and biophysical systems, whereas others incur in negative impacts. We then shed light in ways forward for enhancing sustainability. Building on our review, we discuss four theoretical contributions to guide future research on the sustainability of NTFP use and/or commercialization, namely the SES framework, political ecology, land-change science, and social innovation. Combined, these theories support multidimensional and multi-scalar sustainability analyses. We hence expect that the synergies between these theoretical contributions can steer future research into a direction that unravels broader NTFP and forest values, enhancing sustainability and promoting social-ecological development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Multidimensional analysis; Non-timber forest products; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability","Ecology; Forestry; Timber; Biophysical systems; Ecological development; Ecological interactions; Ecological sustainability; Multi-dimensional analysis; Non-timber forest products; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability analysis; Sustainable development; Dimensions; Ecology; Forest Products; Forestry; Light; Paper Boards; Research; Review","de Mello, N.G.R.; Division of Geography and Tourism, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan, 200E, Belgium; email: natalia.giraorodriguesdemello@kuleuven.be",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Little attention is paid for Non-wood forest products (NWFP), which is not good. This study analyses the diversity in the usage of edible wild plants among the people based in the periphery of the Tala Tala FMU in the North Congo. Methods: An ethnobotanical survey was conducted from 8 to 23 May 2012 on edible NWFP used by Baka and Bakwele populations living in the periphery of the Tala Tala FMU. The method used is the one called «Method for the popular usage», which consists of gathering data on the popular use of forest products in a given area. By comparing the Tala Tala whole population to a forest zone, it is possible to make reconciliations between the systematic botany and the ethnobotany. This reconciliation distinguishes five levels of data collection in the ethnobotany of the Tala Tala including the whole population, the ethnic group, the informant (household), the plant species, and the quotation. We assessed the relative importance, diversity, and similarities in the usages of edible NWFP. Results: A total of 52 households provided information on the popular use of wild edible plants. A total of 57 plant species and 69 recipes were collected for which a total of 594 quotations (citations) were made. These plant species are distributed in 46 genus and 33 families. The Baka and Bakwélé communities use the same plant species and recipes in the same way and with the same importance. The overall usage diversity is higher for both plants and recipes (H>4, E>0.8) among Baka pygmies than Bakwélé people. Conclusions: Some plants used in the Tala Tala FMU are well known in other Congo basin countries for similar usages. Other were identified as ‘’priority’’ or ‘’key’’ edible NWFP. The glaring development challenge of what precedes is the urgent need to assess the abundance (availability) and conduct a structural analysis of the plant species used with the view to propose fair management schemes. © 2020, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

FRI-s was higher than FRI-i, which had a lower importance overall, except for fishing among Caboclos. The differences and similarities found both within and between the social groups refuted this social dichotomy as a major factor mediating the relationship with FR.

In a forest-based bio-economy frame, NWFPs can contribute to human nutrition, renewable materials, and cultural and experiential services, as well as create job and income opportunities in rural areas.

This focus sheds light on the experiences associated withNWFPharvest and use, revealing a fulsome suite of values and economic opportunities that include but are greater than the physical goods themselves. Turning the SDL lens on in-depth case studies from Europe and North America, we show dimensions of forest products that go beyond commercial values but are, at the same time, constituent of commercial activities.

This study involved a comprehensive assessment of the growth, development, and trade of NTFPs in Vietnam by combining logistic and tobit methods. Surveys were used to interview 400 households in three regions of Central Vietnam. Results showed that the planting, development, and trading of NTFPs are shaped by forestry production experience, the number of laborers, the percentage of wage earners, agricultural income, timber income, per capita income, the presence of bank deposits, the distance between forest and house, an understanding of forestry economic policies, and participation in technical training. Each factor had a different level of influence. Among the six NTFP groups, the groups generating yarn and medicines produced the highest income and had a strong impact on household reliance on NTFPs. This was followed by NTFPs used to generate food, oil, and plastic. The proportion of people with wages, and the income variable system, negatively impacted NTFP planting and income generation, which reduced household reliance on NTFPs. This means that there is a trade-off between NTFPs and other income generating activities. In the future, the government should develop specific plans, policies, and strategies for developing each type of NTFP suitable to each region's natural conditions. The policies should include supporting people with low-interest bank loans; expanding the number of training courses to increase their understanding of forestry economic policies; and implementing cultivation techniques and forest care to improve the productivity, quality, and effciency of NTFP products. © 2020 by the authors.","Logistic; Non-timber forest products; NTFPs; Tobit method; Vietnam","Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Logistics; Oils and fats; Planning; Timber; Wages; Comprehensive assessment; Economic development; Income generating activities; Non-timber forest products; NTFPs; Sustainable forest management; Tobit method; Viet Nam; Forestry; cultivation; economic policy; forestry; income distribution; logistics; nontimber forest product; policy approach; survey; trade flow; wage; Cultivation; Economics; Materials Handling; Planning; Salaries; Sustainable Forest Management; Viet Nam","Lv, J.H.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: lvjiehuajiaoshou@126.com",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078533894

Community forest management (CFM) is a practice used to, among other things, resolve land use issues and regulate the extraction and use of non-timber forest product (NTFPs). Managing as a community forest can not only enhance the livelihoods of the local people but also improve their socio-economic condition. This research was conducted at the Ban Mae Chiang Rai Lum Community Forest located in Pa Mae Phrik National Forest Reserve in Thailand’s northern province of Lampang. We collected species biodiversity data of the forest’s total area of 3,925 ha using a systematic sampling method, and twenty-five 40 × 40 m (0.16 ha) survey plots were established in the community forest. Interviews of 159 household heads and/or other household representatives were conducted using a designed questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on information regarding the households’ NTFP utilization habits and engagement in CFM processes. A forest survey was conducted which found that there were 197 plant species, 144 genera, and 62 families in the community forest. Of these, 160 plant species were classified as having medicinal uses, 89 were used as food, 37 as extractives, 32 for firewood, and 12 for fibers. This study also revealed that unmonitored over-exploitation of NTFPs may negatively impact forest biodiversity. As surveyed, 68.55% of households depended on NTFPs. The value of the harvested NTFPs was 6.35% of the total community income. A positive correlation between NTFP income and CFM suggests that utilization of NTFPs combined with CFM can create income opportunities and promote participation in CFM. In addition, income earned from NTFPs and participation in CFM were directly related to the socio-economics of identifiable groups in this community. Laborers, merchants, and low-income families utilized NTFPs to a lesser degree. Single people, household heads, those with a bachelor’s degree, and low income families were less likely to participate in CFM while land owners were more likely to do so. This study implies that the harvesting of NTFPs should not go unchecked, especially of species that are threatened or likely to be threatened if over-harvested. Efforts to enhance lower income household utilization, to more equitably distribute the benefits, and to incentivize community involvement should be prioritized as doing so is crucial to maintaining a healthy supply of NTFPs and safeguarding the community forest biodiversity. © 2020 The Author(s).

Retail market, largely invisible for the official statistics, reveals the lifestyle-related aspects of NWFP trade and may help to understand the flows of this ecosystem service when information on wholesale trade is inaccessible. The prices and flows of most common NWFPs – edible berries, mushrooms and tree sap – in the retail market in Latvia in 2017 and 2018 were analysed based on direct interviews with the sellers in marketplaces and telephone interviews with online retailers. The mean retail prices of NWFPs were compared between statistical regions and years and correlated with socio-economic data and forest characteristics. The directions of the NWFP flows were analysed according to the place of origin and place of retail sales. The highest prices were recorded for stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus Pers.) and Boletes spp. among mushrooms, for wild strawberries (Fragaria vesca L.) among berries and for maple (Acer platanoides L.) sap in the product group of tree sap. The retail price of the same products differed between years, most likely due to the product availability, largely caused by meteorological conditions. In more than half of the cases of recorded sales, NWFPs were consumed in the same region as they were gathered. For other cases of sales, the capital, Rīga, was the main service benefitting area of NWFP retail trade, and the largest part of the products originated from the two closest statistical regions. © 2020, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

This is due to the lack of systematic, periodic and comprehensive market tracking programs. Trade measurement and mapping would allow market actors and stakeholders to improve market conditions, manage NTFP resources, and increase the sustainable production of raw material. This is especially true in the heavily forested and mountainous regions of the eastern United States. This study hypothesized that the tendency to purchase medicinal NTFPs in this region can be predicted using socioeconomic and environmental variables associated with habitat and trade, and those same variables can be used to build more robust estimates of trade volume. American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) dealers were surveyed (n = 700), because by law they must acquire a license to legally trade in this species, and therefore report a business address. They also record purchase data. Similar data are not reported for other medicinal species sold to the same buyers, known colloquially as 'o-roots'. Ginseng buyers were queried about trade activity in eleven commonly-harvested and previously untracked medicinal NTFP species in 15 states. Multinomial logistic regression comprised of socioeconomic and environmental predictors tied to business location was used to determine the probability that a respondent purchased o-roots. Significant predictors included location in a particular subregion, population and percentage of employment in related industries. These variables were used in a two-step cluster analysis to group respondents and nonrespondents. Modeled probabilities for o-root purchasing among respondents in each cluster were used to impute average o-root volumes for a proportion of nonrespondents in the same cluster. Respondent observations and nonrespondent estimations were summed and used to map o-root trade volume and value. Model functionality and estimates of the total volume, value and spatial distribution are discussed. The total value of the species surveyed to harvesters was 4.3 million USD. We also find that 77 percent of the trade value and 73 percent of the trade volume were represented by two species: black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) and goldenseal (Hydrastis canqdensis L.) © 2020 by the authors.","Forest product output; Medicinal plants; Nontimber forest products","Cluster analysis; Forestry; Plants (botany); Raw materials; Sales; Surveys; Sustainable development; Environmental variables; Forest products; Medicinal plants; Mountainous regions; Multinomial logistic regression; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable production; Two-step cluster analysis; Commerce; deciduous forest; forest product; medicinal plant; national trade; nontimber forest product; spatial distribution; Commerce; Forest Products; Forestry; Raw Materials; Sales; Surveys; United States; Cimicifuga dahurica; Cimicifuga racemosa; Hydrastis; Hydrastis canadensis; Panax ginseng; Panax quinquefolius","Kruger, S.D.; US Forest Service Southern Research StationUnited States; email: skruger@vt.edu",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078519251

However, informal markets remain understudied. In this paper, Cycas swamyi, one such important NTFP from southern India has been assessed. C. swamyi is a cycad which has been reported to be overharvested for sale in the ornamental cut flowers and medicinal industry. This species is currently known only from in and around Melkote Wildlife Sanctuary, Karnataka. Supply chain, value chain, and practice of harvesting have been assessed to evaluate the leaf and pith trade and its relation to plant sustainability. Results showed that harvesting is strongly seasonal in the leaf markets. Leaf inflow strongly follows the marriage and festival seasons. Pith trade was not found in the area, though we got to know that it was active during 2004-2010. The pith was being used as an ingredient to prepare medicines in Ayurveda and Siddha systems of medicine. Given that leaf harvest involves complete defoliation and that pith harvest involves lopping of the entire plant, the scale of harvesting documented could jeopardize the remaining populations of these slow-growing and long-lived cycad species. There is an urgent need for conservation and management enforcement to ensure the long-term survival of this plant. Effective legal regulations are imperative, since the harvesting of these products is under high pressure from commercial market sales. Awareness among the user community is also crucial to protect these wild plants from decline. © 2020 Bombay Natural History Society.

Aralia elata is one of the most highly-valued NWFP species in eastern Asia as sources of forest-derived food and traditional medicine. The objective of this study was to value the combined effects of artificial lighting spectra and exponential fertilization (EF) on seedling growth and nutritional responses of this species. One-year old A. elata seedlings were cultured with a 2x2 factorial design in an all-controlled environment to receive EF at 80 and 160 mg N seedling-1 [nitrogen (N)-phosphorus (P)-K, 12-9-12] under lighting spectra by light-emitting diodes (LEDs) (R/G/B, 30:69.3:0.7) and high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps (R/G/B, 44.4:53.8:1.8) at the same light intensity of 60~64 μmol m-2 s-1. After a growing season, seedlings had the greatest height (~60 cm) and root biomass (~700 mg) in the high-dose EF treatment under LED lighting. This combined treatment can also induce a steady-state nutrient uptake for N and P in A. elata seedlings compared to a lower dose of EF in the same LED spectrum. Higher foliar green-color degree suggested lower shoot N concentration but larger leaf area indicated a greater biomass accumulation. Therefore, cultivation of A. elata seedlings with EF at the rate of 160 mg N seedling-1 under a LED lighting spectrum is recommended. © 2020 Friends Science Publishers.","Anthropogenic activity; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Forest food; Nutritional symptom; Restoration",,"Zhao, H.; Research Group of Understory Plant Resources, China; email: zhaohengtian@163.com",,"Friends Science Publishers",15608530,,,,"English","Int.

Uses of various NTFPs have shown significant progress in cultural subsistence, commercial purposes, bioprospecting and sustainable support to forest biodiversity. The present research was conducted in a protected area to document NTFPs of plant origin with their relative importance, to record information for future investigation and discovery of novelty in drug use, and to edify the local communities on sustainable forest management. Methods:The study was aimed to assess the Non-timber forest products of Behali Reserve Forest of Assam. Data was collected from 67 households belonging to two communities, the Karbi and Munda, covering almost 50% of the total households of the studied area using semi-structured questionnaires, personal interviews, group discussions and transect walks from 2017 to 2019. Results: A total of 100 plants falling under 87 genera and 56 families were reported. Urticaceae with 6 species was the most dominant family. Trees with 35% were the most dominant group, followed by shrubs (28%), climbers (22%) and herbs (15%). Out of the reported NTFPs, 51 species (51%) were edibles, 23 species (23%) had ethnomedicinal importance, and 48 species (48%) are treated as having miscellaneous uses. Use value of all the reported species ranged from 0.01 to 0.13. Zanthoxylum oxyphyllum, Hodgsonia macrocarpa, Aristolochia cathcartii and Aristolochia assamica have high UV indicating that these species are most important for the studied population. Informant consensus factor was calculated for the different ailments recorded and a total of seven species were found to have above 70% fidelity level values, showing high reliance of the forest dependent people on these species. Conclusions: The study illustrates a high diversity of NTFPs in the area as well as an intricate relation with the people residing in the fringes of the forest. Anthropogenic activities such as construction of roads, cutting of forests for jhum (shifting) cultivation, natural calamities like landslides etc., were observed to be serious threats to native biodiversity. It is recommended to provide skill development trainings and financial support for the installation of renewable and alternative energy technologies to minimize the use of forest resources in Behali Reserve Forest for better forest sustainability. © 2020, Ilia State University, Institute of Botany, Department of Ethnobotany.

Some of the most used NTFPs in Indonesia are the stems, leaves and fruit of candlenut trees. Candlenut fruit is widely used in the cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and biodiesel industries and is generally used as a cooking ingredient in Indonesia. However, only a limited number of people or community groups manage the forests to increase their income from this business. The aim of this study is to identify business models to serve as the basis for developing alternative business model organizational plans for candlenut extraction. A case study approach was adopted, with in-depth interviews used to collect data. The integration of Business Model Canvas, SWOT Analysis, Internal Factor Evaluation and External Factor Evaluation matrix were used to determine alternative strategies. The results exhibit that the value proposition is the largest barrier for the improvement of these businesses. The Positioning Quadrant SWOT shows that internal factors (strengths and weaknesses) are low, indicating that the candlenut business position is internally weak. However, the scores of external factors (opportunities and threats) are higher implying that there is a great opportunity in the development of candlenut. The alternative strategies to develop candlenut business are to maintain relationships with customers and partners; increasing the quantity and quality of products through technology inputs, promotion, product diversification, and partnership with the government.‬‬ © 2020, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Business model; Business model canvas; Candlenut; IFE-EFE; NTFPs; SWOT",,"Makkarennu; Faculty of Forestry, Jl.

Urbanization has its impact outside its boundary and is determined by the types of services and resources provided by the peripheral areas to the city. Increasing pressure on the natural resources to meet the urban and peri-urban needs leads to jeopardized ecosystems which adversely affect the livelihoods of natural resource dependent peri-urban and rural population. This paper intends to look into the general environmental concerns in the context of Indian peri-urban areas. It analyses the pattern of natural resource use for acquiring livelihoods and unsustainable practices in a peri-urban landscape of Guwahati city, northeast India. A cross-sectional analysis, dividing the landscape into three sections with differential urban impacts have shown that, there have been degradation of resources although increase in income from a few natural resources, particularly aquatic resource. The collection of forest resources other than the non-timber forest products (NTFPs) found decreasing in all the three sections of the landscape. The study findings have implications for landscape planning which concludes that the impacts of unplanned urban activities affecting the natural resources in the fringe areas have been realized by the local population. Although expansion of the city has acknowledged the area as eco-sensitive zone, further policy revision is essential to conserve ecosystem and to ensure sustainable and enhanced ecosystem services to cater the needs of both rural and urban population. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,"Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Urban planning; Cross sectional analysis; Ecosystem services; Environmental concerns; Forest resources; Landscape planning; Local populations; Natural resource use; Non-timber forest products; Natural resources","Nautiyal, S.; Centre for Ecological Economics and Natural Resources (CEENR), Nagarabhavi, India; email: nautiyal_sunil@rediffmail.com",,"Springer",18635520,,,,"English","Environ.

Traditionally, forested and fallow land are rotated in a slash and burn cycle that has created an agricultural mosaic, including secondary forest, known as the rural complex. This study investigates the land use context of new forest clearing (during 2000-2015) in primary forest areas outside of the established rural complex. These new forest clearings occur as either rural complex expansion (RCE) or isolated forest perforations (IFP), with consequent implications on the forest ecosystem and biodiversity habitat. During 2000-2015, subsistence agriculture was the dominant driver of forest clearing for both extension of settled areas and pioneer clearings removed from settled areas. Less than 1% of clearing was directly attributable to land uses such as mining, plantations, and logging, showing that the impact of commercial operations in the DRC is currently dwarfed by a reliance on small-holder shifting cultivation. However, analyzing the landscape context showed that large-scale agroindustry and resource extraction activities lead to increased forest loss and degradation beyond their previously-understood footprints. The worker populations drawn to these areas create communities that rely on shifting cultivation and non-timber forest products (NTFP) for food, energy, and building materials. An estimated 12% of forest loss within the RCE and 9% of the area of IFP was found to be within 5 km of mines, logging, or plantations. Given increasing demographic and commercial pressures on DRC's forests, it will be crucial to factor in this landscape-level land use change dynamic in land use planning and sustainability-focused governance. © 2020 by the authors.","Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC); Land cover and land use(LULC); Landscape-Scale",,"Molinario, G.; Department of Geographical Sciences, United States; email: gmolinar@umd.edu",,"MDPI AG",2073445X,,,,"English","Land",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078676036

Soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), an oilseed crop has the potential to fill the gap between demand and domestic oilseeds production in Pakistan. Soybean seed contains 40-42% protein, 20-22% oil contents, and 20-30% carbohydrates along with numerous other essential vitamins and minerals and termed as a 'miracle crop' and potential food security crop. Soybean was introduced in Pakistan as an oilseed crop during the early 1960s, but its cultivation remained limited until 1970s when adaptability and production trials conducted all over the county yielded promising results. Based on these trials' vast areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP, formerly NWFP), Punjab and Sindh were found most suitable for commercial cultivation of soybean. However, at the onset of the current century, soybean cultivation was halted, and it gradually disappeared from cropping schemes of Pakistan. In the current review, we have analyzed the available literature and observed that despite suitable agro-ecological conditions, soybean is facing several challenges such as lack of germplasm with specific maturity groups adaptable to various environmental conditions, unavailability of climate-resilient high yielding and pest resistant genotypes and lack of marketing facilities. Moreover, the absence of area-specific production technology, non-existence of extension service, and lack of coherent policy to promote local oilseed production are the major bottlenecks for the cultivation of soybean in Pakistan. Along with the identification of gaps for low cultivation of soybean in Pakistan, we have proposed potential solutions for enhancing the cultivation of this very important oilseed legume for improved national food security. © 2020 Friends Science Publishers.","Adaptability; Combat strategies; Genotypes; Glycine max; Limiting factors",,"Asad, S.A.; Centre for Climate Research and Development (CCRD), Pakistan; email: saeed.asad@comsats.edu.pk

This contradicts with the poverty line of the state. Stable income helps a family to get a proper education, good health care and food security throughout the year. The major source of income for rural society is from agriculture and forest products which is seasonal. The purpose of this study is to understand various possibility through which income can be generated and the reasons why many of those possibilities are not considered by the people to earn stable income in Malgaon, Chhattisgarh. To perceive the grassroot reasons ethnographic research methodology was implemented which involved living along with the villagers for a week. Information and details pertaining to the study were gathered through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) using tools like resource mapping, season mapping, interviewing 25 villagers and discussions with opinion leaders. The results showed that lack of knowledge, reluctance to experiment technological advances, inefficient utilization of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP), ignorance of products from cattle stock and exploitation by middlemen are the main reasons for low-income generation. This study discusses the solutions to the existing obstacles and various resource opportunities available in the village that have the potential to increase the income generated by transforming the hard work of the villagers to smart work. Villagers are unaware of the higher profit value of the finished goods from forest products.

Over-collection of orchids for salep is believed to be a growing threat to wild species, yet very little research has concentrated on orchid populations in the wild. Here, we studied the impact of salep collection on population demographic parameters and uniformity of distribution patterns of the Elder-flowered orchid, Dactylorhiza sambucina, the most commonly collected orchid in northern Greece. Methods: We carried out fieldwork in four meadows where salep harvesting occurs, and conducted interviews in villages close to these sites. Fieldwork focused on the demographic parameters of orchid populations and on the characteristics of their habitat (natural-anthropogenic). We also measured population size and distribution, extent and multi-scale density, comparing distributions to Poisson and fractal models. Results: According to interviews, salep collection by the local community has decreased, contrary to collection by people outside the community, which is increasing. Interviewees did not believe that orchid abundance was higher in the past; they claim that it can be very variable. None of the participants seemed aware of the legislation to conserve orchids. Demographic parameters did not seem to be strongly dependent on whether it was a harvested and non-harvested sites and population density was greatest in the site of highest collection pressure. Conclusions: Our findings show that salep collection is still ongoing in Epirus. Our interview results and our population study indicate that current levels of collection are not significantly affecting the abundance of the Elder-flowered orchid in Epirus subalpine meadows. However, the expanding commercial collection could reach levels that threaten the species. There is a need for a longer-term monitoring of these orchid populations, and a more effective modeling of the species' response to different harvesting pressures. © 2019 The Author(s).","Conservation value; Illegal trade; Non Timber Forest Products (NTFP); Northern Greece; Northern Pindos National Park; Orchids; Salep; Wild products",,"Halley, J.M.; Laboratory of Ecology, Greece; email: jhalley@cc.uoi.gr",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",1790045X,,,,"English","J.

A core one is the local agro-ecological potential because it moulds possible land use options and the potential balance between agricultural and NTFP activities. Using income surveys of 1200 households, this paper examined the absolute and relative contribution of NTFP income at six sites each paired across a gradient of differing agro-ecological potential. The results showed a mean income share from NTFPs of 15% when state social grants are included in household income, or 30% when social grants are excluded. There was a U-shaped relationship between NTFP income share and agro-ecological potential, being highest in sites of very low and of high potential and lower at more intermediate levels. There was a positive association between NTFP income and arable agriculture income. These results indicate complex interactions between choice of household income strategies and local environmental conditions, which require greater appreciation in NTFP studies and land use planning. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Agriculture; Ecology; Land use; Agro-ecological zones; Environmental conditions; Intermediate level; Land Use Planning; Non-timber forest products; Potential balance; Relative contribution; Rural livelihood; Rural areas; Agriculture; Cores; Ecology; Forest Products; Land Use; Sites; South Africa; Surveys","Mugido, W.3 Esplendor, 161, Freesia Street, Lynnwood Ridge, South Africa; email: wmugido@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Many former fields experience a change in vegetation composition and structure post-abandonment, typically through a process of plant succession. The changes in species and abundance mean that the nature and quantity of ecosystem services provided by the former fields also varies. We examined the types of provisioning services obtained from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) with increasing age since field abandonment. We sampled 43 former fields ranging in age since abandonment from approximately 7 to 55 years, and seven plots in intact forests. We held seven focus group discussions with local residents to determine uses of species found in the former fields. Plant cover and species richness increased with former field age, although old field community composition was also influenced by soil chemistry. Of the 177 species recorded, 70 (40%) had one or more uses, spanning six NTFP categories namely, food, building, medicinal, craft, cultural and energy. The number of NTFP species increased with increasing age of the former field, but the proportion of NTFP species declined from 80% in the youngest former fields to 65% in the oldest ones, which were similar to the 63% recorded within intact forests. The youngest former fields had more medicinal species than the older ones, as the abundance and diversity of herbaceous species declined with increasing woody plant cover. Species used for building and food (especially fruits) peaked when the former fields became dominated by woody plants.

Nees) Blume is an endemic tree of up to 20 meters tall that grows in the surrounding forest in the Kerinci regency. Cinnamon is one of the most valuable non-timber forest products (NTFP) harvested from Kerinci. The tree is classified as an NTFP based on criteria set out by a regulation of the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry in 2007. As a result, it must be harvested sustainably. Its massive cultivation has caused deforestation in several areas in Kerinci. The objective of this paper is to assess the environmental impacts of continuous C. burmannii harvesting of the bark by clearcutting the whole tree. Intensive clearcutting, slash, and burn posed a significant threat for (wildlife) biodiversity in the habitat of C. burmannii. The study was performed in collaboration with the Institute for Agricultural Technology of Jambi (BPTP) from October 2018-January 2019. A harvester group in Lempur Mudik village was surveyed through a semi-structured questionnaire, focus group discussions, interviews and direct observations on C. burmannii production methods and their impact on forest conservation. We discuss how young farmers can contribute to forest conservation through sustainable harvesting of cinnamon. We conclude by suggesting leverages for forest conservation and by proposing actions from the local and national governments that should be urgently taken to safeguard wildlife biodiversity in the surrounding forest. © 2019 by the authors.","Cinnamon; Conservation; Sustainable harvesting","bark; biodiversity; clearcutting; conservation management; cultivation; deforestation; environmental impact; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainability; Indonesia; Jambi [Indonesia]; Cinnamomum burmannii; Cinnamomum verum","Speelman, S.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Coupure Links 653, Belgium; email: stijn.speelman@ugent.be",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076669793

However, harvesting is rarely the only pressure on NTFP populations, and it is vital that the effects of interactive pressures be considered. This applies to Boswellia serrata, an NTFP tree species which is widely harvested for gum-resin used in religious practices. However, in many settings populations are in decline, presumably due to heavy harvesting, but other factors may play a role, such as altered fire regimes and invasive species. Here we report on the effects of harvesting and invasion by Lantana camara on B. serrata populations in three protected areas in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in southern India. We considered tree and juvenile density, size class distribution, and growth, mortality, and recruitment rates in harvested and unharvested populations over two years. Generally, tree density was higher in harvested populations. The negative effects of harvesting were most apparent at the site with the greatest harvesting pressure, with only limited effects at the other two sites, as reflected in the size class distribution and mortality and recruitment rates. Increasing cover of L. camara was associated with declining densities of B. serrata juveniles and, to a lesser extent, adult trees. The impact of L. camara cover was generally higher than that of gum-resin harvest. The results show that the viability of B. serrata populations is negatively affected by both harvesting and Lantana invasion, and that appropriate management intervention needs to be considered to address these. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Density; Growth; Gum-resin; Lantana cover; Mortality; Recruitment; Size-class profile","Biodiversity; Conservation; Density (specific gravity); Forestry; Growth (materials); Harvesting; Resins; Gum resins; Lantana cover; Mortality; Recruitment; Size class; Population statistics; biodiversity; conservation management; herb; invasive species; land cover; mortality; nontimber forest product; population decline; population density; population distribution; population dynamics; population growth; population size; population structure; protected area; recruitment (population dynamics); species conservation; Biodiversity; Conservation; Forestry; Harvesting; Mortality; Recruitment; India; Western Ghats; Boswellia serrata; Lantana; Lantana camara","Soumya, K.V.; Dept of Environmental Science, South Africa; email: soumyakori89@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The aim of this study is to define the set of criteria and indicators (C&I) to evaluate the sustainability of NWTPs' commercial supply chains in the Nordic forests. The set of C&I, including 13 sub-criteria and 48 indicators, was defined based on earlier research. As a case study, the developed set of C&I was tested with four bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) supply chains. Experts evaluated the fulfilment of indicators in each chain, and example consumers gave weights to the criteria. The results reveal that there is a lack of sustainability especially in social dimension, for example in involving forest owners and the local community. Weights given by the example consumers highlight their preferences, in this case rights of employees. The set of C&I defined serves especially companies operating in NTFP businesses; it helps to perceive the sustainability gaps in operations of companies. Moreover, the set of C&I is a tool to promote discussions with stakeholders and test the sustainability of new business models for the developing branch of business. As a next step, the C&I defined needs to be further tested in different levels and with different NTFPs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Criteria; Everyman's right; Indicators; Social license to operate; Stakeholders","Indicators (instruments); Supply chains; Sustainable development; Timber; Criteria; Criteria and indicators; Everyman's right; License to operate; New business models; Non-timber forest products; Stakeholders; Vaccinium myrtillus; Forestry; Chains; Consumers; Criteria; Forestry; Forests; Indicators; Set; Supply","Hamunen, K.; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Yliopistokatu 6 B, Finland; email: katri.hamunen@luke.fi",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Its special focus is to investigate the impact of Global Memorandum of Understandings (GMOUs) on rural young people involved in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for sustainable livelihood in Niger Delta, Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this study were collected from primary sources, using participatory rural appraisal technique of semi-structured interview questionnaire. The use of participatory research techniques in collecting CSR impact data especially as it concerns the rural young people is because it involves the people being studied, and their views on all the issues are paramount. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse the data. Inferential statistical tool – estimation of logit model was used to test the two research hypothesis. Findings: The results indicate that GMoUs have not given adequate attention to young people as a special target sub-group who live in rural areas and depend mostly on NTFPs. Results also show that a number of factors hindering rural young people from the use and development of NTFPs include a policy vacuum, non-destructive harvesting, and destruction of natural habitats, bushfires, population growths and high demands. Research limitations/implications: The semi-structured interview questionnaire was directly administered by the researchers with the help of research assistants. The use of local research assistants was because of the inability of the researchers to speak the different local languages and dialects of the many ethnic groups of Ijaws, Ogonis, Ikweres, Etches, Ekpeyes, Ogbas, Engennes, Obolos, Isokos, Nembes, Okirikas, Kalabaris, Urhobos, Iteskiris, Igbos, Ika-Igbos, Ndonis, Orons, Ibenos, Yorubas, Ibibios, Anangs, Efiks, Bekwarras, Binis, Eshans, Etsakos, Owans, Itigidis, Epies, Akokoedos, Yakkurs, etc., in the sampled rural communities. Practical implications: An appropriate GMoU-intervention framework for sustainable promotion of NTFPs, domestication of NFTPs, improving harvesting and processing techniques are necessary to facilitate good security, reduction of poverty and improved livelihoods, particularly for the economically-marginalized and forest-dependent rural young people is imperative. Social implications: Sustainable livelihoods of the forest-dependent rural young people in sub-Saharan Africa would require some focussed CSR interventions on the NTFPs for sustainable livelihood. Facilities pertaining to storage, grading, processing and value addition through the convergence of existing schemes and programmes should be promoted and created. MOCs are in a position to empower the rural young people with information about the market, policy and products to enable the rural people strategizing and accessing returns from NTFPs in sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: This research adds to the literature on multinational enterprises’ CSR initiatives in developing countries and rationale for demands for social projects by host communities. It concludes that business has an obligation to help in solving problems of sustainable livelihood. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Corporate social responsibility; Economic empowerment; Multinational oil companies; Non-timber forest products; Rural young people; Sub-Saharan Africa",,"Uduji, J.I.; Department of Marketing, Nigeria; email: joseph.uduji@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",17506204,,,,"English","J.

Since the areas areadjacent to the local community which has long time accessed and utilized non-timber forest products (NTFPs), it is necessary to take forest management efforts to ensure a sustainable protection function while the needs of the community around the forest are fulfilled wisely. One of the critical parts of forest management is to define the distribution of NTFPs clearly to allow effective governance of natural forest area. A stratified systematic sampling survey was applied to find the type of NTFP and its location within the protected areas for each estate. GIS technology was used to map the distribution of NTFPs.26.67% ofincense was most widely distributed by in the Germ-Plasm Protection area of Aek Nauli Estate, and 20.00% was in the Riparian zone area of Habinsaran Estate. At the pole growth stage, 20,00% of incense was often found in the Green Belt area of AekNauli Estate, and 28.00% was in the Buffer Zone area .

Background and Objectives: NTFPs, such as wild foods, medicinal plants, and raw materials for handicrafts, make significant contributions to rural livelihoods. NTFPs can help fulfil households' subsistence and consumption needs, serve as a safety-net in times of crises, and provide cash income. In particular, the processing of NTFPs has often been suggested to positively influence sustainable economic development in rural areas. However, despite rising interest and recognition of the potential contributions of such industries as key sources of employment and their strategic role in overall growth strategies of developing countries, many NTFP processing enterprises remain in the informal sector and an in-depth understanding of the underlying factors is lacking. This review aims to identify enabling and constraining factors affecting NTFP processing enterprises. Materials and Methods: Using systematic review methodology, studies investigating commercialized, processed NTFPs and their economic impacts have been identified and the current evidence base with regard to NTFP processing and small and medium sized enterprise (SME) development synthesized. Results: Despite the diverse nature of NTFPs, a number of constraining and enabling factors affecting NTFP processing and commercialization were identified. The former includes aspects such as the lack of resource access (finances, skills, technologies, etc.), market information, and basic infrastructure; the latter, amongst others, the role of key entrepreneurs; and cooperation across the value chain, amongst producers, and among members of the institutional environment or an abundant resource base. Moving from small-scale NTFP commercialization in local markets to more mature NTFP value chains reaching export markets, the increasing role of cooperation and having a supportive institutional framework in place, becomes apparent. Conclusions: Overall, successful NTFP processing strongly depends on the socio-economic and environmental context in question, requiring a holistic approach tailored to the respective context and value chain. © 2019 by the authors.","Commercialization; NTFP; Processing; SME","Commerce; Developing countries; Employment; Forestry; Mobile telecommunication systems; Processing; Raw materials; Regional planning; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Timber; Commercialization; Environmental contexts; Institutional framework; Non-timber forest products; NTFP; Small and medium enterprise; Small- and medium-sized enterprise; Sustainable economic development; Economic and social effects; commercialization; economic impact; environmental values; holistic approach; literature review; livelihood; nontimber forest product; rural development; small and medium-sized enterprise; socioeconomic impact; Commerce; Developing Countries; Employment; Forestry; Processing; Raw Materials","Meinhold, K.; Faculty of Life Sciences, Marie-Curie-Straße 1, Germany; email: kathrin.meinhold@hochschule-rhein-waal.de",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075426918

Following the recognition of cocoa agroforests as being useful for biodiversity conservation and farmers’ livelihoods, there is a growing discourse on the fact that they may also be useful in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Several companies have expressed their willingness to be “deforestation” certified within the next two decades. In West and Central Africa, cocoa is part of the endeavour to contribute to the REDD+ mechanism. Besides producing cocoa beans, the additional expectations from cocoa agroforests (timber, NWFP, biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, etc…) depend on the trees associated with the cocoa plants. The manner in which associated trees are mixed in the system impacts on the cocoa plants and plants associated with cocoa trees within the agroforestry system thus impact on the products and services produced by these farming systems. Studies are being undertaken to identify the exact composition of these associated trees but very few deal with the manner in which these trees are structurally distributed—vertically and horizontally—within the cocoa agroforest. Understanding the way in which cocoa and non-cocoa trees are distributed within the system would be useful with a view to improving the farm system, thus meeting the needs of several stakeholders. The present study reviews the structure of cocoa orchards and agroforests in West and Central Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire) with a view to improving the products and services of cocoa landscapes. This review is centred around: (i) density of cocoa, (ii) density of associated plants, (iii) basal area or associated plants, (iv) stratification and space between components, and (v) the life cycle of cocoa plantation components. Densities of cocoa and associated plants in the field are not always those advised by extension services. The cocoa varieties play an important role in type and intensity of shade of the cocoa farms. In the context of multiple expectations placed on cocoa plantations, the unproductive cocoa trees in the farmer fields can be substituted by more vigorous ones or replaced by useful associated plants (Timber and NWFP). With the growing desire to reproduce some key attributes of local forests while responding to other economic and social needs associated with cocoa farms, the neighbouring/previous forest climax and its related basal area can be considered as a reasonable aim, when managing the cocoa agroforest. The life cycle of each of the plant components needs to be optimized in these spatial–temporal intensification considerations. In the prospect of vertical intensification, there is a need to give more attention to understorey management and the number of strata of the agroforest. In the context of sustainable management, a well-structured cocoa agroforest system needs to take landscape, local, national and global socio-economic and political issues into consideration. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Cocoa landscape; Ecological services; Forest biodiversity; Non-cocoa associated plants; Structure of cocoa agroforest","agricultural land; agroforestry; basal area; biodiversity; climate change; cocoa; ecological approach; ecosystem service; farming system; life cycle; livelihood; population density; stand structure; Cameroon; Cote d'Ivoire; Ghana; Nigeria; Theobroma cacao","Sonwa, D.J.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), PO Box 2008, Cameroon; email: dsonwa@cgiar.org",,"Springer Netherlands",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

However, little empirical evidence has been provided on the combination of participating in both of the aforementioned income diversification strategies (IDS) and an assessment of the correlation with economic welfare. This study aims to fulfill the knowledge gap by identifying the determinants of IDS and empirically assessing the association between the IDS and household welfare and resource allocation of forestry farm households in China. Using a unique survey data of 3099 forestry farm households from seven provinces of China, a recently-developed multi-valued treatment effect model was estimated to address the potential selectivity bias. The empirical results show that household size, labor force, forestland size, farmland size, access to the forestland property certificate, human capital of the household head, and regional heterogeneity are associated with the IDS decisions. Farm households that participate in IDS have a higher value of forestry income, agricultural income, off-farm income, consumption, savings, and lower odds of relative poverty compared with their counterparts without IDS participation. The improvement in economic performance, as a result of IDS, is possible because of an efficient reallocation of family resources and a high likelihood of receiving government financial and technical support. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","China; Economic welfare; Non-wood forest products (NWFP); Off-farm work; Resources allocation","agricultural land; empirical analysis; heterogeneity; household income; nontimber forest product; participatory approach; resource allocation; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach","Dai, Y.-W.; School of Management, China; email: fjdyw@163.com",,"Springer Netherlands",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

Four marketing channels were identified, and the profit margins of traders varied depending on the channel. The market concentration ratio showed an oligopoly market structure, indicating that the market was not competitive. The average annual income of traders was US$ 221.53, which represented 63.3% of the poverty threshold estimated at US$ 350 in 2016 in Mali. However, there is a potential for much higher gains and a more efficient marketing system.

Geographical distribution and climate correlates of bioactive compounds are important to the regional management for the natural reserves of medical plants in forests. In this study, we collected Eleutherococcus senticosus individuals from 27 plots to map the special distribution of concentrations of eleutheroside B, eleutheroside E, and isofraxidin in forests of Northeast China. Compound concentrations in both aerial and underground organs were further detected for relationships with the average of 20-year records of temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity (RH). We found higher shoot eleutheroside B concentration in populations in northern and low-temperature regions (R = -0.4394; P = 0.0218) and in eastern and high-RH montane forests (R = 0.5003; P = 0.0079). The maximum-likelihood regression indicated that both RH (Pr > Chi-square, 0.0201) and longitude (Pr > Chi-square, 0.0026) had positive contributions to eleutheroside B concentration in roots, but precipitation had strongly negative contributions to the concentrations of eleutheroside E (Pr > Chi-square, 0.0309) and isofraxidin (Pr > Chi-square, 0.0014) in roots. Both geography and climate factors had effects on the special distribution of medical compounds in E. senticosus plants in natural populations in Northeast China.

They extract gum-resin from Boswellia serrata Roxb. in Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Tiger Reserve (BRT), Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (CWS), and Malai Mahadeshwara Wildlife Sanctuary (MMH) in the state of Karnataka, India. They use gum-resin as a cultural offering to the deities in the temples in these study sites and in their households. The traditional harvesting practices adopted by the Soliga tribes in these protected areas, types of gum-resin extracted, and the nature of the extraction processes were examined. The research undertook 346 household surveys with gum-resin harvesters and non-harvesters across 15 villages, along with 60 field trips with the harvesters, during which field harvesting activities and practices were noted. Six different types of gum-resin were harvested, with marked differences between the three sites. Because of the different types of gum-resin, the quantities harvested were also significantly different between sites. Approximately 80% of the harvesters were aware of some harmful methods of harvesting gum-resin, and some harvesters highlighted that B. serrata trees would yield gum-resin only when damaged. Such damage could be human-made or through the effects of elephants, wind, Trigona honey harvest, deer horns or body rubbing and longhorn beetles. Most (81%) of the non-harvesters surveyed previously practiced gum-resin harvesting but had ceased for a variety of reasons, mostly because of insufficient demand and hence income from the sale of gum-resin, insufficient supply, or fear of wild animals in the forests. Considering these cultural practices, experiences, and beliefs of the Soliga communities can help inform management plans and conservation of the species in its natural habitat. © 2019 by the authors.","Cultural NTFP; Gum-resin; Harvesting practice; Indian frankincense; Soliga","Animals; Conservation; Environmental protection; Forestry; Harvesters; Harvesting; Surveys; Timber; Cultural NTFP; Cultural practices; Gum resins; Harvesting activities; Indian frankincense; Non-timber forest products; Soliga; State of karnataka; Resins; harvesting; nontimber forest product; protected area; resin; traditional knowledge; tree; Animals; Conservation; Forestry; Harvesters; Harvesting; Surveys; India; Karnataka; Western Ghats; Animalia; Boswellia serrata; Cervidae; Coleoptera; Elephantidae; Trigona","Soumya, K.V.; Department of Environmental Science, South Africa; email: soumyakori89@gmail.com",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073458087

The scarcity of business and employment opportunities often push the forest proximate communities to tap a range of NTFPs for earning their livelihoods. In many forest-based communities around the world, children are actively involved in NTFPs collection, which is likely to affect the socioeconomic paradigms of these children. We aim to investigate how the NTFP collection venture affects the education of the children involved in the forest proximate communities of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Pakistan. A stratified sampling followed by a series of focus group discussions and one-to-one interviews were carried out to collect information on collection behaviour, patterns, income generation, and other socioeconomic variables. We used a binary logistic regression model to explain children's state of attending schools using a range of socioeconomic variables. The empirical evidence showed that 42% of the NTFP-collecting children were not going to school, and nearly two-thirds were working in unfavourable working environments. The regression model showed that the role and behaviour of contractors, along with factors like household conditions, were important factors in employing children for long working hours.

Fieldwork was conducted in September 2015 and March and April 2016 in Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, using participatory rural appraisals and structured questionnaire interviews with randomly selected 310 households. The results of the study are reported. In the survey area, eight NTFPs were identified as the most important for the daily life of local people. Many NTFPs were self-sufficiently collected and consumed by the surveyed households. Regarding the institutional management of NTFPs, the local institutions play the greatest role to enhance NTFPs’ sustainable use. The government was not sufficiently involved in the regulation and management of NTFPs. As a result of the examination, the reason for the absence of NTFPs from national policies and strategies is the insufficient information available regarding both their value as subsistence and trading products and their contribution to rural livelihoods. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Cambodia; Development agendas; Institutional management; Non-timber forest products; Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary; Utilization","development strategy; government; household survey; institutional framework; livelihood; national planning; nontimber forest product; participatory rural appraisal; questionnaire survey; resource use; Cambodia; Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary","Chou, P.; Graduate School of International Development, Japan; email: chou.phanith@d.mbox.nagoya-u.ac.jp",,"Springer Netherlands",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

However, there is a noted paucity of studies addressing the determinants of and contributors to income generation of smallholders around the world, particularly in the Amazon forest. Moreover, while road development in the Amazon has been heavily discussed, the impacts of infrastructure projects, such as road paving, on smallholders’ livelihoods remain uncertain. Here we explore the relevance of agriculture, livestock rearing and collection of non-timber forest products (NTFP) as income providers of smallholders in the Amazon forest in Madre de Dios-Peru, after the paving of Interoceanic South Highway (ISH), a large infrastructural project connecting Acre state in Brazil with Cusco in Peru. We interviewed 62 smallholder families in an area of 403 km2 along the road from Iñapari to Mazuko near the tri-national border of Brazil, Perú and Bolivia. We applied a multinomial statistical model to estimate the proportion of annual net revenue related to each productive system from selected predictor variables. Our results show that smallholders’ net revenue originates from a mix of productive systems including agriculture (rice, corn), livestock rearing (cows) and others (poultry, pigs, sheep) as well as NTFP extractivist activities (Brazil nut). Average net revenue is of USD 35.2 ± 25.7 ha−1yr−1 suggesting that economic returns to smallholders remain low even after the paving of ISH. This indicates that connection with markets alone is not sufficient to increase rents of smallholder families. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon forest livelihoods; Interoceanic Highway; Land use rents; Smallholders","Forestry; Land use; Mammals; Pavements; Amazon forests; Economic development; Infrastructure project; Interoceanic Highway; Non-timber forest products; Relative contribution; Smallholders; Statistical modeling; Economics; economic development; food production; livelihood; market conditions; motorway; nontimber forest product; smallholder; socioeconomic conditions; Acre [Brazil]; Amazonia; Bolivia; Brazil; Cuzco [Cuzco (DPR)]; Cuzco [Peru]; Madre de Dios; Peru; Bertholletia excelsa; Ovis aries; Suidae; Zea mays","Carvalho-Ribeiro, S.M.; Instituto de Geociências, Av.

Of the three most important NTFPs in the Brazilian Amazon – rubber, Brazil nut, and açaí – the latter is the least known, but the one with the most potential and fastest growing markets. Here we map the socioecology of açaí extractive systems in the Western Amazon state of Acre, Brazil. We interviewed 49 extractivists in settlements and in the emblematic Extractivist Reserve Chico Mendes (RCM) to model ecology (tree density, productivity) and production chain of açaí (prices, costs and net revenues) for an area of 164,000 km2. We estimate a potential annual production of 850 thousand tons for the entire Acre State, which could generate net revenues of US$ 71 million/yr. This is well above the average production of 136 thousand tonnes (over the last 25 years). Net revenues average US$ 57 ha−1.yr−1, with açaí contributing, on average, to 17% of the annual household income. In two case studies, we found a diversity of livelihoods comprising agriculture, NTFP collection, and livestock rearing that were grouped in two broad types of extractivist livelihoods: “old” and “new” settlers. Our results suggest that old settlers tend to focus on cattle ranching as their main economic activity, even inside extractive reserves (RESEX). The shift from extractivist activities to cattle ranching undermines the conservation role of this type of protected area. We conclude that without significant financial support in the forms of subsidies and other development programs NTFPs will continue to struggle against the economics of cattle ranching. © 2018","Extractivist landscapes; Sustainable livelihoods; Sustainable use reserves","Conservation; Costs; Ecology; Forestry; Timber; Development programs; Economic activities; Euterpe precatoria marts; Extractive reserves; Extractivist landscapes; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable livelihood; Sustainable use; Economics; conservation status; cost analysis; dicotyledon; economic activity; economics; landscape; livelihood; livestock; mapping method; market conditions; nontimber forest product; protected area; ranching; rearing; sustainability; Acre [Brazil]; Amazonia; Brazil; Bertholletia excelsa; Bos; Euterpe precatoria","Carvalho Ribeiro, S.; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Av.

Wild edible fungi (WEF) are frequently collected, sold, and consumed by households because of their high nutritional and economic value. Rational utilisation of WEF is imperative in balancing ecological protection and household livelihood development. Most existing studies concerning NTFPs or WEF utilisation combine collecting, selling, and reselling behaviours, but few studies focus on single behaviours, such as selling, that provide direct household income. Based on questionnaire survey data obtained from 193 households that collect WEF in nearby forests in the Wanzhou district of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, this study employed a logistic regression model to analyse the factors determining whether households sold the WEF they had collected. Results indicated that the decision to sell WEF was influenced by the amount of WEF collected, mastery of market information, distance from residence to main roadside selling points, and household income. Education, number of women in the household, and distance from collection points to residence were not influential. Based on the findings, this study suggests that implementing changes to the WEF market and local forest management system could improve household livelihood and reduce area poverty by enabling efficient use of WEF to generate greater sales revenue. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Household behaviour; Household livelihood; Non-timber forest products; Wild edible fungi","Commerce; Economic analysis; Fungi; Regression analysis; Sales; Surveys; Timber; Edible fungus; Forest management systems; Household behaviour; Household livelihood; Logistic Regression modeling; Non-timber forest products; Questionnaire surveys; Three gorges reservoir area; Forestry; edible species; forest management; fungus; household income; livelihood; logistics; nontimber forest product; poverty; questionnaire survey; Commerce; Economic Analysis; Fungi; Regression Analysis; Sales; Surveys; China; Chongqing; Three Gorges Reservoir; Wanzhou; Fungi","Wang, Y.; Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, China; email: wangyukuan@imde.ac.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Useful trees are often retained when forests are converted to farmland. Allanblackia stuhlmannii is a common forest tree on farmland. Due to the high-quality seed oil, a wish to conserve the species and to provide farmers with income from seed sale, efforts have been made for large-scale production by smallholders. The strategy includes maintenance of existing trees on farmland and rejuvenation by planting. An adoptability survey was conducted among 225 seed collectors and farmers in 10 villages in East Usambara. Results showed that the traditional open fruit collection from farmland trees had become more restrictive. Adoption by farmers was slow. Although seeds were collected from standing trees, barriers to cultivation were long juvenile period, competition with crops, lack of space for tree planting and potential waste of land for male trees. The greatest obstacle was the preference for other tree species. Economic calculations showed that the production of Allanblackia seed was not competitive compared to clove and cinnamon. The study shows that although several NTFPs are collected, only Allanblackia was cultivated. The study questions whether Allanblackia cultivation, based entirely on smallholders, is sustainable. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adoption; Agroforestry; Allanblackia stuhlmannii; domestication; income from trees; native tree species; NTFP; species preference","adaptive management; agricultural production; agroforestry; angiosperm; competition (economics); domestication; income; nontimber forest product; preference behavior; smallholder; Tanga [Tanzania]; Tanzania; Usambara Mountains; Cinnamomum verum; Syzygium aromaticum","Schmidt, L.; Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, Denmark; email: lsc@ign.ku.dk",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14728028,,FTLOA,,"English","For.

Although ginseng has a broad distribution range, populations are declining due to several factors including overharvesting and habitat degradation. We designed experiments to study the effects of soil and aspect on ginseng to better identify potential reintroduction sites. We hypothesized soil and aspect would have a significant effect on ginseng performance. Performance included growth (leaf area, height, number of prongs) and reproduction (inflorescence presence). We predicted ginseng would have greatest performance in calcium-rich loam soil, on north-facing slopes. After four growing seasons, we found only soil had a significant effect on growth. This was a consistent result over four growing seasons. On average, ginseng grown in limed loam soil were 55-mm taller with 20,000 mm2 more leaf area and more prongs than ginseng grown in soils lower in calcium. Aspect did not affect any measured variables. Given these results, we suggest identifying soils with higher levels of calcium regardless of aspect as potential ginseng habitat. This experimental study contributes to a more complete understanding of the ecology of ginseng.

Few studies have documented the extraction volumes for illicitly traded orchids, the status of the populations affected by this activity, the socioeconomic profiles of the vendors, or the factors determining income, which are essential for designing strategies to conserve this resource. We documented species richness, abundance, and prices for orchids traded during December in traditional markets in Chiapas, Mexico. The relationships among price, species showiness, and some variables determining income were evaluated. We recorded 28 traded species, all of which were extracted from neighboring, protected, and high-biodiversity forests. The most income was generated from three species, which were also the most abundant in the markets. This trade affects the conservation of two threatened Mexican orchids, but at a state level, it also impacts populations of other species that are not considered at risk. A significant relationship was found between the price of an orchid and its flower size and between the vendor’s income and the quantity of orchids traded by him. The income obtained by a vendor was significantly explained by orchid inflorescence abundance, vendor’s age, and a biodiversity index estimated here. © 2019, The New York Botanical Garden.","ethnobotany; Illicit wildlife trade; income diversification; NWFP; poverty alleviation; threatened species",,"Solano, R.; Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Hornos 1003, Mexico; email: solanogo@yahoo.com.mx",,"Springer New York LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

Their potential to strengthen the economic viability of rural economies appears to be high, particularly in regions where wood is not the most profitable forest product. However, information on NWFP production potentials are scarce and tools to support forest owners in decision making about NWFP management are rarely available. Considering the complex relationships between a sustained production of NWFPs, the use of the available ecological resources, as well as the organizational and the market potential of forest management regimes, we introduce a knowledge-based expert model for supporting NWFP management. In a mixed-method approach qualitative and quantitative techniques are combined to depict regional production and business potentials of NWFPs, explicitly addressing different environmental and socio-economic contexts. For the model building multi-criteria analysis methods were used for preference elicitations in an iterative form, including stakeholders and experts. Within two distinct case study settings (i.e. Austria and Finland) the expert model is tested for applicability and to depict the most suitable option from a suite of selected NWFPs. Results for both case studies well reflect current NWFP business potentials and provide insights to the opportunities of mixing more resilient and more risky NWFPs to a solid regional business portfolio, fostering the co-production of wood and non-wood resources. The approach presented has a potential to steer the mindset of different forest owner types to critically revise their interests in forest management. It could act as an eye-opener for forestry-oriented stakeholders who have not yet considered NWFPs as potential assets in forest management systems. With its ability to include various NWFPs and to consider different forest owner preferences, future applications can be tailored towards the needs of both small-scale (non-industrial) forest owners and bigger forest holdings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Decision making; Economics; Iterative methods; Knowledge based systems; Wood; Complex relationships; Ecological resources; Forest management systems; Future applications; Multi Criteria Analysis; Non-wood forest products; Preference elicitation; Quantitative techniques; Forestry; Austria; Decision Making; Economics; Forestry; Iterative Methods; Wood","Huber, P.; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Vienna (BOKU), Peter Jordanstr. 82, Austria; email: patrick.huber@boku.ac.at",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

In addition to their use as food, WEF species may also yield fiber, fuel, and a range of processed products. Besides forests, WEF species also thrive in diverse environments, such as agroforestry and urban landscapes, deserts, fallows, natural lands, and plantations. Given the multifunctional, ubiquitous nature of WEFs, we conducted a systematic review on the literature specific to WEFs and highlighted links between different domains of the wider knowledge on NTFPs. We found that literature specific to WEFs was limited, and a majority of it reported ethnobotanical and taxonomic descriptions, with relatively few studies on landscape ecology, economics, and conservation of WEFs. Our review identifies priorities and emerging avenues for research and policymaking to promote sustainable WEF management and use, and subsequent biodiversity and habitat conservation. In particular, we recommend that ecosystem services, economic incentives, market innovations, and stakeholder synergies are incorporated into WEF conservation strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Conservation; Markets; Non-timber forest products; Policy; Research priorities; Sustainability; Wild edible fruits","Arid regions; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Ecosystems; Fruits; Marketing; Public policy; Sustainable development; Timber; Conservation strategies; Economic incentive; Ecosystem services; Edible fruits; Habitat conservation; Non-timber forest products; Processed products; Research priorities; Forestry; ecosystem service; edible species; forest management; forestry policy; nature conservation; nontimber forest product; research; sustainable forestry; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Ecosystems; Fruits; Marketing","Sardeshpande, M.; Department of Environmental Science, South Africa; email: g17s8926@campus.ru.ac.za",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068829025

Better management and conservation practices will only be possible with an in-depth knowledge of tree species ecology. This study aimed to assess the spatial association of fruit yield of Bertholletia excelsa (B. excelsa) trees in two forest types (old growth terra firme forest and Amazon-cerrado transitional forest) in the Brazilian Amazon. Fruit yield was measured in both forest types during 2010. At each forest type, fruit yield was divided into different yield classes (number of fruits) for subsequent spatial modeling. The bivariate Ripley's K-function was applied to quantify the spatial association of fruit yield of B. excelsa trees over different fruit yield classes. The results revealed that the forest type influences the spatial association of B. excelsa fruit yield. The old growth terra firme forest presented random spatial association for fruit yield, which implies that fruit yield of B. excelsa trees in this forest type is not limited by tree location and site resources. On the other hand, the Amazon-cerrado transitional forest presented significant negative spatial association for fruit yield across different yield classes, which means that under some conditions fruit yield of a given tree influences the fruit yield of the neighboring tree in this forest type. Site resources in the Amazon-cerrado transitional forest is limited and naturally favors inter- and intra-specific competition. Finally, the results imply the need for adoption of different management and conservation strategies for B. excelsa in different forest types in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bivariate Ripley's K-function; Brazil nut; Modeling","Conservation; Fruits; Models; Brazil nut; Brazilian Amazon; In-depth knowledge; Intraspecific competition; Management and conservations; Non-timber forest products; Ripley's K function; Spatial associations; Forestry; cerrado; conservation management; crop yield; deciduous tree; ecological modeling; forest management; forest resource; nontimber forest product; nut; old-growth forest; spatial analysis; Conservation; Forestry; Fruits; Management; Models; Trees; Type; Yield; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Bertholletia excelsa","Batista, A.P.B.; Department of Forest Science, Campus Universitário, Campus Box 3037, Brazil; email: anderson.batista@ifam.edu.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Yet, the annual marketed quantities vary considerably, causing instability in supply chains. Thus, climatic and economic factors affecting the annually aggregated supply of top-marketed mushrooms (ceps, milk caps, and chanterelle) and berries (bilberry, cowberry, and cloudberry) in Finland were studied. Data on mushroom and berry market prices (€/kg) and quantities (kg) were obtained from the statistics on annual quantities of berries and mushrooms bought by organized trade and industry in Finland (1978-2016). The species-specific supply functions were described as linear regression models, where annually aggregated quantities were predicted as a function of climatic and economic variables. Our results suggested that climatic variables influenced the marketed quantities of NTFPs through the biological yields of berries and mushrooms, and that the market price had a negative effect on the marketed quantities of ceps, milk caps, and berries. The markets for NTFPs have become more international at the second half of the study period (1999-2016), modifying the price-quantity relationships of ceps, milk caps and cloudberries. Additionally, the number of visas issued to Thai pickers increased the marketed quantities of bilberries and cowberries. © 2019 by the authors.","Boletus edulis; Chantharellus cibarius; Forest berries; Lactarius spp.; Non-timber forest products; Rubus chamaemorus; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Wild edible fungi","Forestry; Fruits; Fungi; International trade; Regression analysis; Supply chains; Timber; Boletus edulis; Chantharellus cibarius; Edible fungus; Forest berries; Lactarius; Non-timber forest products; Rubus chamaemorus; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea; Economic and social effects; climate effect; climate variation; crop yield; economic impact; food market; fruit; fungus; mushroom; nontimber forest product; Finland; Foreign Trade; Forestry; Fruits; Fungi; Regression Analysis; Finland; Basidiomycota; Boletus edulis; Cantharellus cibarius; Fungi; Lactarius; Rubus chamaemorus; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","Tahvanainen, V.; Faculty of Science and Forestry, P.O.

In Myanmar, poor regulation and unsustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is affecting millions of hectares of natural forests; overexploitation of forest resources is one of the main drivers of forest degradation. Although evidence shows that the extraction of NTFPs results in forest degradation, there have been few studies on what drives rural people to depend on NTFPs and how to address these drivers in terms of policies and measures. Policies and measures are nationally enacted policies and actions that countries undertake to address the causes of deforestation and forest degradation. This study identifies which factors determine the dependence on NTFPs in forest-dependent communities. From these factors, we derived policy implications for the main causes of overexploitation of NTFPs to provide suggestions for developing policies and measures in the design of national Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) strategies. Focusing on the Taungoo District as a case of dependence on NTFPs by local communities, we conducted a qualitative and quantitative data collection procedure based on interviewing households in the local communities. NTFPs contributed the most to total household income and the main types of NTFPs exploited were charcoal making and bamboo selling. Households with lower education level, less agricultural land, less income from off-farm activities, lived under the poverty line or used only charcoal were more dependent on NTFPs in the study areas. Poverty and fuelwood usage were factors affecting NTFPs dependence for landowners while rice insufficiency, off-farm income and fuelwood usage most affected the NTFPs dependence for landless people. The results suggested that national strategies for REDD+ should take into account local features such as income opportunities and land tenure in order to make local people cooperate with the government to avoid deforestation and forest degradation. © 2019 by the authors.","Livelihood dependency; Myanmar; Non-timber forest products; Policy; REDD+","Charcoal; Deforestation; Digital storage; Extraction; Timber; Wood products; Forest-dependent communities; Livelihood dependency; Myanmars; National strategies; Non-timber forest products; Policies and measures; Policy implications; REDD; Public policy; deforestation; emission control; exploitation; fuelwood; household income; livelihood; nontimber forest product; policy development; Charcoal; Deforestation; Degradation; Extraction; Forest Products; Land; Utilization; Wood Products; Bago; Myanmar; Taungoo","Yeo-Chang, Y.; Department of Forest Sciences, 1 Gwanakro, South Korea; email: youn@snu.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066240790

The data collected were analyzed through descriptive statistics and Chi-Square (χ2) test. Insignificant values of Chi-Square (χ2) test reveal that there is no association or relationship of NTFP dependency with the socioeconomic and demographic variables of the respondents. The communities do rely on NTFPs for their daily, sociocultural, and cash requirements and assure a safety net during scarcity. There is a variable contribution of NTFPs to total monthly household income (1–70%). We documented 43 species of NTFPs sold either as raw or as processed form. The NTFPs sold were in the form of twigs, shoot, fruit, seed, leaves, mushroom, and fish.

Here our primary focus is on analyzing the quantitative contributions of these oak-pistachio tree savannas to rural household incomes in Malekshahi County, Ilam Province, considering both cash and subsistence sources, and direct as well as indirect incomes. Direct forest-extractive incomes prove to be comparatively small (6% of household incomes), and are dominated by foods (wild vegetables, pistachios, and fruits), fuels, and livestock feeds. However, forest incomes are egalitarian in distribution, and strategic in their nature: they keep one-fifth of households from falling below the poverty line. The poorest are thus also more forest- and firewood-reliant, but more surprisingly, so are specialized pastoralists. Moreover, indirect benefits in terms of forest inputs into agriculture are crucial: 20–25% of the crops are planted in tree savannas generating 7–9% of household incomes. All forests support goat and sheep grazing in the dry season as a vital refuge of vegetation resources, likely with an even higher value of household income (around 10%).

However, political support mechanisms explicitly targeting NTFP remain underdeveloped. In this study, we aimed to contribute to the design of support mechanisms by understanding the factors that influence the commercialisation of wild plants by organic farmers. We first developed a conceptual framework based on fifteen factors and then applied the framework to a case study in South Tyrol (Alto Adige), Italy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all fourteen members of the Vereinigung Südtiroler Kräuteranbauer (Associazione Coltivatori Sudtirolesi Piante Officinali), who commercialised wild plant species, and the data were then analysed using qualitative content analysis. Agricultural intensification, pesticide drift, limited access to gathering sites suitable for organic certification, legal restrictions, lack of consumer awareness about the additional value of organic wild plant certification, and limited product diversity were perceived as limiting factors; management techniques in organic farming, organic certification, a trend for wild, regional and healthy foods, the availability of training, and favourable cultural values and attitudes towards wild plant gathering were perceived as supportive. This study offers a comprehensive understanding of the many diverse factors that may influence wild plant commercialisation in Europe and beyond and provides guidance on how political support mechanisms could unlock the much heralded potential of wild plant commercialisation for rural development. © 2019 by the authors.","Ethnobotany; Foraging; Health foods; Medicinal and aromatic plants; Organic agriculture; Organic consumer; Policy; Traditional knowledge; Wild food; Wild herbs","agricultural policy; commercial species; commercialization; conceptual framework; ethnobotany; forage; herb; medicinal plant; nontimber forest product; organic farming; pesticide application; timber certification; traditional agriculture; wild population; Alto Adige; Italy; Italy; Trentino-Alto Adige","Schunko, C.; Department of Sustainable Agricultural Systems, Gregor-Mendel-Strasse 33, Austria; email: christoph.schunko@boku.ac.at",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064074732

We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (n = 20) and positive (n = 12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges.

Addressing these problems requires identifying the factors that facilitate or impede crop-raiding by forest elephants. Yet to date, the environmental or anthropogenic factors that influence the occurrence and intensity of crop-raiding by forest elephants are largely unknown. We used a multivariate approach to investigate conditions under which forest elephants raid some fields and not others in the buffer zone of Monts de Cristal National Park (MCNP), Gabon. We first interviewed 121 farmers from 11 villages situated within 10 km of MCNP regarding the occurrence of elephant crop-raiding of their fields. We then collected data on 39 explanatory variables to characterize the agricultural fields. Of these, the most important predictors of elephant raid occurrence of crop damage were presence of fruit trees, elephant deterrents (scarecrows, fire, wire string fences and empty barrels), and field topography. We secondly assessed the effect of stage of crop growth, presence of fruit trees, field topography and presence of elephant deterrents on crop-raiding occurrence and intensity by counting raids and measuring areas of crop damage every week in 17 plantations over 19 weeks in the most elephant-impacted zone of the study area. We found that fruit presence and stage of crop growth led to more intense damage to crops, whereas local deterrents did not inhibit raiding events and crop damage by elephants. We report a tradeoff between non-timber forest products (NTFP) services and crop-raiding by elephants. We show for the first time that steep topography impedes elephant damage to crops with no raids recorded in fields with surrounding slopes greater than 25%. We discuss whether farming on steep fields could be used as a strategy for mitigating crop-raiding to favor human-elephant coexistence and enhance elephant conservation.

The NWFP is a science-based plan incorporating monitoring and adaptive management and provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of policy. We used >25 years of region-wide bird surveys, forest data, and landownership maps to test this policy’s effect on biodiversity. Clearcutting decreased rapidly, and we expected populations of older-forest–associated birds to stabilize on federal land, but to continue declining on private industrial lands where clearcutting continued. In contrast, we expected declines in early-seral–associated species on federal land because of reduced anthropogenic disturbance since the NWFP. Bayesian hierarchical models revealed that bird species’ population trends tracked changes in forest composition. However, against our expectations, declines of birds associated with older forests accelerated. These declines are partly explained by losses of older forests due to fire on federal land and continued clearcutting elsewhere. Indeed, the NWFP anticipated that reversing declines of older forests would take time. Overall, the early-seral ecosystem area was stable, but declined in two ecoregions—the Coast Range and Cascades—along with early-seral bird populations. Although the NWFP halted clearcutting on federal land, this has so far been insufficient to reverse declines in older-forest–associated bird populations. These findings underscore the importance of continuing to prioritize older forests under the NWFP and ensuring that the recently proposed creation of early-seral ecosystems does not impede the conservation and development of older-forest structure. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Conservation efforts that focus on poverty alleviation, work on the premise that an increase in household wealth decreases use of forest resources. We surveyed 1222 households across four tiger reserves to test the paradigm that an increase in assets leads to reduced forest use and we also assess the effects of other socio-economic factors. We find that increase in assets may reduce Non-timber Forest Product (NTFP) collection, but may not necessarily reduce livestock numbers or use of wood as a cooking fuel. Households that faced more economic setbacks were more likely to state that they wanted more livestock in the future. Education is positively associated with choosing Liquefied Petroleum Gas as a cooking fuel in the future. We find site and resource-specific variation. Fifty percent of all households (range across sites: 6–98) want to collect NTFP while 91% (range: 87–96) want to retain or own more livestock over the next 5–10 years.

However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Climate adaptation; Family forest landowner; Non-industrial private forest landowner (NIPF); Non-timber forest product (NTFP); Sugar maple; Sugaring","Timber; Climate adaptation; Family forests; Non-industrial private forest landowners; Non-timber forest products; Sugar maple; Sugaring; Forestry; adaptive management; climate conditions; deciduous tree; landowner; methodology; nontimber forest product; private land; public attitude; technology; Acer saccharum; agricultural parameters; Article; climate change; forest pest; health; lake; nonhuman; physical capacity; reverse osmosis; social adaptation; United States; weather; Acer; attitude; Michigan; Minnesota; Wisconsin; Minnesota; United States; Acer; Acer saccharum; Acer; Attitude; Lakes; Michigan; Minnesota; Wisconsin","Snyder, S.A.; Operations Research Analyst, 1992 Folwell Avenue, United States; email: stephanie.a.snyder@usda.gov",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"30688998","English","Environ.

Recent reports have highlighted decreases in natural populations caused by increased harvest intensity. Oregano leaf harvesting is a complex problem, involving different components and views, and has a clear spatial dimension. We proposed an analytical framework based on multi-criteria-multi-objective analyses. GIS tools were used as the platform for managing, displaying and analyzing ecological and socioeconomic information from different sources in order to evaluate land suitability of three different management strategies for two competing land objectives: oregano Harvest and oregano Regeneration. The incorporation of environmental evaluation criteria in the analysis allowed the identification of new potential oregano harvesting areas which were neither reported by harvesters, nor registered during harvesting trips. Socio-economic criteria, such as land tenure, highlighted the fact that a substantial proportion of current oregano harvesting areas are located outside ejido limits resulting in potential conflicts for resource access. The proposed Balanced oregano management strategy, in which the same proportion of suitable area (50%) was assigned to both objectives, represents the most favorable management strategy. This option allows harvesters to continue earning an income from oregano leaf harvest; and at the same time helps in the selection of the best areas for oregano regeneration. It also represents a management strategy with a smaller impact on oregano populations and on the harvesters´ income, as well as lower monitoring costs. The proposed analytical framework may contribute to advance the application of systematic approaches for solving decision-making problems in areas where oregano leaves and other NTFP are harvested. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation; Harvesting; Multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA); Multiobjective land allocation (MOLA); Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Regeneration","analytical framework; conservation management; GIS; harvesting; land evaluation; multicriteria analysis; nontimber forest product; regeneration; socioeconomic survey; sustainable development; Mexico [North America]; Lippia graveolens; Origanum","Luz María del Carmen, C.-I.; Unidad de Recursos Naturales, A.C.

Pond water, sediments and fish tissue (gill, liver, gut and skin) samples from both sources were analyzed for pathogens and heavy metal levels. Escherichia coli populations in the sediments and water from the WFP exceeded the maximum permissible limit by 2–3 log units as expected. Significantly higher levels of pathogen contamination were detected in the gut and skin of fish from the WFP than the NWFP. Heavy metal concentrations in all samples fell within the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) permissible limits except for iron and cadmium. There were significantly higher heavy metal concentrations in gill and liver than the muscle. Even though iron recorded the highest concentrations in fish tissue, the concentrations (0.1–2.0 mg kg−1) were below the expected daily nutritional requirement (1–2 mg) for humans and pose no toxicological risk.

At the northern periphery of the Boumba-Bek National Park in Southeast Cameroon, little is known about which habitat type contain the highest abundance of NTFP species. In this study, we assessed habitat diversity and variation in the abundance of eight priority NTFP species comprising: Afrostyrax lepidophyllus, Baillonella toxisperma, Irvingia gabonensis, Panda oleosa, Pentaclethra macrophylla, Ricinodendron heudelotii, Scorodophloeus zenkeri and Tetrapleura tetraptera. The inventory was done along 16 linear transects of 5000 m × 20 m, and all the individuals, from juveniles (DBH < 5 cm) to mature trees (DBH > 5 cm) of the eight NTFPs were recorded. Habitat types were characterized along transects following basic forest classification system used in ecology and then measured. Results: In total, 13 different habitat types were identified with young secondary forests and periodically flooded forests representing 32.70% and 26.31% respectively. The least represented habitat was young fallows with Chromolaena odorata (0.08%). Seven NTFPs (A. lepidophyllus, B. toxisperma, I. gabonensis, P. oleosa, P. macrophylla, R. heudelotii and T. tetraptera) were predominantly represented in young secondary forests whereas S. zenkeri was more abundant in young Marantaceae secondary forests. The different types of young secondary forests identified seem to be favourable for the growth of the eight NTFPs. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that habitat fragmentation driven by human activities such as industrial logging and shifting cultivation destroy the forest ecosystems and has a strong influence on the sustainability of the major NTFPs in the locality. © 2019 The Author(s).","Exploitation; Forest resources; Human activities; NTFPs; Sustainability","forest inventory; forest resource; habitat fragmentation; habitat type; human activity; nontimber forest product; sampling; secondary forest; sustainability; transect; Cameroon; Afrostyrax; Baillonella toxisperma; Chromolaena odorata; Irvingia gabonensis; Marantaceae; Panda oleosa; Pentaclethra macrophylla; Ricinodendron heudelotii; Scorodophloeus zenkeri; Tetrapleura tetraptera; Cameroon; environmental protection; forestry; growth, development and aging; physiology; population density; rain forest; recreational park; tree; Cameroon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Parks, Recreational; Population Density; Rainforest; Trees","Ngansop, T.M.; University of Yaoundé I, P.O.

This paper makes a contribution in this regard, using household data (N = 200) from eight villages around the Kilum-Ijim Forest Landscape of Cameroon. The ordinary least square and the logit model are used to explore the determinants of livelihood diversification and the likelihood of forest dependence, respectively. The diversification patterns were analysed using a simple t-test, and the multinomial logit for conservation choices. We find that forest-related activities are a source of livelihood diversification for 63% of households, with non-timber forest products (NTFP) domestication (31%) and medicinal plant extraction (30%) being the most preferred. For non-forest activities, migration is the most preferred diversification strategy. Generally, households with favourable socio-economic status prefer non-forest to forest activities for livelihood diversification. The regression estimates indicate that older respondents are more likely to depend on the forest than the young, whereas males and individuals with at least some secondary education are less likely than their respective counterparts to rely on the forest. The results also suggest those who participated in training, educated household heads and older individuals are significantly more likely to choose high-valued diversification strategies. Concerning conservation activities, households with favourable socio-economic status are on average less likely to adopt NTFP domestication and more likely to adopt bee-keeping as a conservation choice. The results suggest the need for policy considerations to: (i) effectively integrate women in forest management processes, (ii) intensify trainings for conservation-friendly diversification approaches, (iii) regulate unclean energy use and (iv) encourage value chain improvement for conservation-friendly products. © 2019 by the authors.","Cameroon; Conservation choices; Forest dependence; Forest policy; Livelihood diversification","Conservation; Economics; Plants (botany); Public policy; Cameroon; Conservation activities; Diversification strategies; Forest dependence; Forest policy; Livelihood diversification; Non-timber forest products; Ordinary least squares; Forestry; forest management; forestry policy; livelihood; nature conservation; rural area; socioeconomic status; Cameroon; Conservation; Diversification; Economics; Forest Management; Forest Products; Forestry; Patterns; Cameroon; Apoidea","Kimengsi, J.N.; Institute for Tropical Forestry and Forest Products, Germany; email: jude_ndzifon.kimengsi@tu-dresden.de",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060436432

As access to natural resources becomes increasingly contested in these contexts, it is helpful to better understand the economic value of environmental resources, including ‘degraded’ forests, for rural livelihoods. The ‘environmental income’ from these environmental resources remains underappreciated, in part because of methodological limitations, and is reflected in policy decisions favouring conversion of this natural capital to various forms of agricultural concession. This study draws from immersive fieldwork in four villages in Lao PDR to provide more rigorous evidence about the value of natural capital to rural households. Results show that environmental income was important to all wealth classes of rural households, averaging 23% of total annual household livelihood income. Our findings are consistent with global assessments, help explain why rural Lao people contest development that compromises the natural capital from which they derive environmental income, and emphasise the importance of recognising environmental income in land use and development policies and programmes in Lao PDR. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Environmental income; Lao PDR; Laos; livelihoods; NTFP (Non Timber Forest Product); rural resources; shifting agriculture","agriculture; environmental economics; income; livelihood; natural capital; nontimber forest product; rural area; village; Laos","Van Der Meer Simo, A.; Fenner School of the Environment and Society, Australia; email: alex.vandermeer@anu.edu.au",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14728028,,FTLOA,,"English","For.

The economic interpretation of Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) is associated with the perspective of the state, and with the modernist farming project exploitatively converting indigenous practices into plantation relations.

One local innovation to implement NFPP while allowing worker households alternative use of forestland is the “Contract Management Responsibility System (CMRS)”. Under CMRS, participating households have exclusive rights to harvest and grow non-timber forest products (NTFP) while fulfilling forest protection responsibility. Using two rounds of survey data, we evaluate the impact of CMRS on forest worker households’ livelihood and the sustainability of NTFPs. We also test and correct for the bias from attrition and self-selection simultaneously. We find that CMRS leads to a significant increase in household income from NTFPs’ production. We also find that increased NTFP species collected is associated with longer CMRS participation, which indicates improved sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Attrition and self-selection; Contract management responsibility system; Household livelihood; NTFPs; Sustainability","Human resource management; Sustainable development; Timber; Alternative livelihoods; Attrition and self-selection; Contract management; Forest protection; Household livelihood; Management regime; Non-timber forest products; NTFPs; Forestry; Computer Programs; Data; Forest Products; Forestry; Impact; Management; Protection; Test Methods","Xu, J.; National School of Development, China; email: xujt@nsd.pku.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

However, there are growing concerns of overexploitation of NTFPs driven by poverty and policy neglect that threaten the sustainability of the NTFP resource base in Kassena-Nankana West District (KNWD) of Ghana. The study investigated the contribution of income from NTFPs to household income and socioeconomic factors that influence the collection and marketing of NTFPs in KNWD. Using a multistage sampling technique, quantitative data were collected from 375 households through structured survey questionnaires. Qualitative data were gathered through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field observations. Results showed that income from NTFPs forms a significant part of household income with a contribution of 32.69 percent to household income. Regression analysis revealed sex of respondent (P ¼ 0.057), household size (P ¼ 0.046), agricultural land size (P ¼ 0.000), NTFP retailers (P ¼ 0.000), NTFP wholesalers (P ¼ 0.000), and value-added NTFPs (P ¼ 0.000) as significantly and positively correlated with income from NTFPs. Results further indicated that poor households depend primarily on NTFPs in order to achieve their subsistence and income needs compared to high-income households. This research recommends that stakeholders and policymakers consider the needs of forest-dependent communities in policy analysis on NTFP conservation measures. Also, the role of households, especially the low income (poor), in the management of forest resources should be spelled out since they depend primarily on NTFPs to meet their subsistence and income needs.

However, easily occurring hydrogen evolution at a negative potential is a huge barrier to the application of anode materials in ASIBs. Even the most promising insert-type anode material, NaTi2(PO4)3 (NTP), cannot be commercialized due to its inadequate operating potential (-0.807 V vs. Ag/AgCl) that is close to the hydrogen evolution potential (-0.817 V vs. Ag/AgCl). Here, we report a redox potential regulation strategy to overcome this technical problem by integrating the redox couples of Ti4+/Ti3+ and Fe3+/Fe2+ to yield Na1.5Ti1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NTFP) and increasing its operating potential up to-0.721 V vs. Ag/AgCl, which effectively prevents the potential overlap with the reductive decomposition of H2O. Importantly, the excellent electrochemical properties and low energy consuming synthetic route to NTFP open a new perspective to energetically develop low cost and highly stable ASIBs as a large-scale energy storage tool. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Anodes; Costs; Energy storage; Hydrogen; Iron compounds; Metal ions; Redox reactions; Sodium compounds; Titanium compounds; Anode material; Energy storage systems; Highly stables; Hydrogen evolution; Negative potential; Redox potentials; Reductive decomposition; Synthetic routes; Sodium-ion batteries","Han, J.; State Key Laboratory of Material Processing and Die and Mould Technology, China; email: jthan@hust.edu.cn",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",20507488,,JMCAE,,"English","J.

Information on the value of NTFPs for subsistence use and trade is often inadequate due to market failure. This potrays a wrong message that non-marketed products lack economic value and are not worth protecting. The study estimated the value of NTFPs from Mabira Central Forest Reserve used for subsistence and trade by adjacent communities. Data were collected through key informant interviews, questionnaire survey of 342 resource users and spot market analysis to establish the market value of used NTFPs. Mainly poor women and men aged below 61 years and with low education levels extracted NTFPs. The annual value of identified NTFPs was $ 860, 470 of which $ 58, 688 was attributed to subsistence use and $ 801, 782 to cash income. NTFPs value varied significantly between products (F=1.67, df 16 p=0.05) and between villages (F=0.000, df 13, p<0.05) with charcoal offering the highest annual value ($ 327, 686) and palm leaves - the lowest ($ 187). NTFPs from Mabira CFR have a high potential to enhance livelihoods of the poor, women and youth in the study area if sustainably harvested since availability of some plant species used for firewood and charcoal production were reported to be declining. These results indicate the need for urgent intervention measures for alternative sources of income and sustainable extraction of NTFPs to minimize pressure on the forest reserve. © 2019 Lesotekhnicheski Universitet (University of Forestry).

The study showed that the production of yerba mate is concentrated in the middle, west, and southeast regions. The production of palm heart is concentrated in the Curitiba metropolitan mesoregion, and all the mesoregions produce a significant amount of pinhão. The Curitiba metropolitan mesoregion produces the highest amount of resin and the northwest mesoregion produces the highest amount of latex. In conclusion, it was proved that a regional analysis using LQ is a valuable tool for characterizing the Paraná mesoregions based on their participation in the production of the five most important NTFPs. In addition, it was proved that LQ is a valuable tool for identifying the productive potential of the mesoregions of the five most important NTFPs. Thus, to encourage regional development, stakeholders may incorporate this analysis in their policies, to enable the society to benefit. © 2019 Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana.","Mesoregion; Planning; Rural development",,"Bittencourt, K.C.; Federal University of Paraná, Brazil; email: keila_cbittencourt@yahoo.com.br",,"Fundacao de Pesquisas Florestais do Parana",00153826,,,,"English","Floresta",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073202833

To monitor understory light condition at large scale faces significant obstacles from heavy canopy shade and high cost of sensors arrangement. Therefore, we employed a novel methodology to meter the relative light ratio between plots under canopy and in the open-air. In this study, a number of 34 plots of natural Aralia elata populations were investigated for forest structure across six types of forests at Northeast China. Light properties of relative intensity, photosynthetic photon flux rate (PPFD), spectra in red, green, and blue wavelengths, and relative ratio of red/green, red/blue, and green/blue were measured at the height of 1.3m. Leaves of A. elata were collected to determined concentrations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), starch, and soluble sugars. We found that relative blue light ratio was different among forest-types, but it had little further effect on leaf traits in A. elata. Instead, higher ratios of relative green light and green/blue depressed leaf P concentration. Increases in PPFD and light intensity promoted leaf N and P concentrations, respectively. The red/green ratio had adverse relationships with leaf P and starch concentrations in A. elata. In conclusion, due to the variation understory light condition, sites with low canopy density would benefit leaf N concentration and those with larger canopies can promote leaf starch accumulation in A. elata. © 2019, Editura Silvica.

Socioeconomic factors such as a better education, income, land holding size, have been used to understand the patterns of consumption of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Ethnicity, and especially whether or not people are indigenous to the forested areas, may also change consumption patterns. In this study we analysed the socioeconomic factors, indigeneity and geographical locations of people living in the buffer zones of Vietnam’s Bu Gia Map National Park to better understand the key determinants of the consumption of NTFPs. We conducted 121 interviews with local households and found that indigeneity, education, family size, and the area of land used were statistically significant in explaining the amount of NTFPs consumed, while indigeneity and area of land used by local people had positive relationships with the diversity (measured in number of categories) of NTFPs consumed by local people. Interestingly, there were statistically significant effects of interactions between the area of land used and indigeneity on the consumption of NTFPs. The amount of these products is important for indigenous people who belong to the groups using small and medium areas of land. The medium land use group consumed significantly fewer categories of NTFPs than the small and large land use groups. This data may help local managers to develop interventions that support biodiversity conservation, promote sustainability of these important resources and improve the social welfare of marginal groups. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","consumption of forest products; immigrants; Indigenous people; non-timber forest products; socioeconomic factors","buffer zone; ethnicity; forest product; immigrant; indigenous population; national park; nontimber forest product; socioeconomic conditions","Nguyen, T.; Department, Australia; email: nvtoai@hotmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13504509,,IJSDB,,"English","Int.

There is a bidara laut wood processing industry in West Nusa Tenggara that produces drinking cups called ‘health cups’ utilizing bidara laut. All raw materials used for the production of health cups are, however, obtained from bidara laut stands in forest areas, which may cause the extinction of this medicinal plant species if the highly intensive raw material harvesting in the forest is not supported with cultivation of this plant species. To preserve this plant species, the Institute for Research and Development of Non-Timber Forest Products Technology (NTFP-RDI) has carried out breeding activities by developing a collection garden of this species from the populations of Bali and West Nusa Tenggara (Lombok and Sumbawa Islands). The initial step carried out was the exploration of the parent trees followed by collection of generative materials (seeds) and nurseries. Exploration of bidara laut parent trees on Lombok Island was carried out in Gunung Tunak Ecotourism Park using a purposive sampling method, followed by collection of fruits to obtain seed propagating materials for establishment of seedling nurseries. Twenty-five parent trees were identified with average height of nine m, stem diameter of 24 cm and stem straightness scales of 1-3. The average seed produced was 413 seeds tree-1. Three parent trees were selected based on the highest seed germination rates, namely parent trees number 6, 14 and 20.

Flowering and fruiting of 64 individual clumps with 570 stems > 2 m and 43 clumps with 478 stems > 2 m respectively were recorded on a monthly basis. Results showed that flowering and fruiting of Jernang took place throughout the year with a peak in April and May and at low level in September to March. Duration of male inflorescences was 2-3 months. Fruits were usually harvested for resin 2-3 months after flowering. Sex ratio of clusters was about 1:1. Flowers and fruits were produced on vigorously growing stems that had reached canopy light exposure. Clusters consisted of from 2 to 36 stems. In some clusters, all stems bore reproductive organs; in others, only few stems had flowers or fruits. Female clusters had significantly more stems than male clusters, but male clusters produced more inflorescences than did females. About 80% of the clusters during the first year’s survey and 50% the second year produced flowers. The most vigorous male clusters produced more than 80 inflorescences with up to 15 on a single stem within a year. The highest producing female clusters produced 12 inflorescences in a year with up to five inflorescences and four infructescences per stem in a year. The data was primarily collected by trained local monitors. They knew the species well and were used to spot flowers and fruits. However, since the local monitors were also all Jernang collectors, they usually picked fruits before maturity, and the full development into mature fruits was thus interrupted. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Aromatic resins are valuable non-wood forest products (NWFPs) derived from Boswellia and Commiphora species in the drylands of this region. The study seeks to answer the following main questions: ""What are the ecological and livelihood roles of resin producing species, and the role that people have in either degrading or restoring these ecosystems?"" ""Who are the participants in frankincense and myrrh production, processing, and trade, and how do these people interact?"" ""What is the current and potential future economic impact of frankincense and myrrh production and trade at the household level?"" ""What are the barriers to enhanced economic outcomes?"" The study involves the use of PRISMA method-a systematic methodology to identify, select and analyze the recent literature on aromatic resins in relation to such factors as socio-economic situation, livelihood security, value chain, climate change adaptation, ecology and sustainable development in the Horn of Africa. Systematic identification of publications was conducted using several sources, including but not limited to electronic databases for literature search. Web of Science, Social Science Citation Index and Google Scholar and various scientific journals were investigated using search terms and restrictions. A total of 991 references were retrieved, but literature only published between 2003 to 2017 was selected, which led to the use of 51 works for full-text assessment. The results indicate that of the 51 selected studies, 45% focused on ecology and sustainable management, 31% on economic contribution and livelihood security, 20% on production and value chain development, and 4% on climate change adaptation and mitigation. It could be concluded that farmers' adoption of Boswellia and Commiphora species as economic tree crops in the Horn of Africa has a distinct role in biodiversity conservation and climate change adaptation by contributing to the sustainability of ecosystem functioning as well as improving household incomes and the rural livelihood security in general, and thereby facilitating poverty alleviation. © 2019 by the authors.","Aromatic resins; Climate change adaptation and mitigation; Frankincense and myrrh; Livelihood security; Non-wood forest products; Rural development","Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Biodiversity; Commerce; Composting; Conservation; Crops; Ecosystems; Forestry; Regional planning; Resins; Sustainable development; Climate change adaptation; Frankincense and myrrh; Livelihood security; Non-wood forest products; Rural development; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; economic impact; livelihood; mitigation; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; resin; rural development; rural economy; woodland; Aromatic Compounds; Biodiversity; Commerce; Composting; Conservation; Farm Crops; Horn of Africa; Acacia; Boswellia; Boswellia sacra; Commiphora","Hassan, B.A.; Viikki Tropical Resources Institute (VITRI), P.O.

As such they are of interest to a wide disciplinary range of researchers and development and government agencies seeking to promote livelihoods, incomes, and ecologically sustainable practices. With the attention on the various human uses of NTFPs, their role and networks in the broader biological communities in which they are located are frequently overlooked. Harvesting of many NTFPs has effects not only at the organism and population scales, but also on co-occurring species, some of which may also be NTFPs. Thus, reduction or loss of one NTFP population or species in a specific area may have cascade effects on other NTFP species, including those used for cultural purposes. We illustrate the little appreciated importance of NTFPs in broader ecological and social systems by assessing and illustrating the importance of NTFP species as ecological or biocultural keystones in providing regulating and supporting ecological services to other species and cultural services to people. We present a number of examples where NTFP species act as keystones in ecological and cultural systems, including food, pollination and dispersal, animal health, nutrients, shelter and protection, and cultural symbolism, most of which have not been considered by NTFP researchers and practitioners. From these examples we distill six propositions regarding NTFPs and discuss the value of recognizing some NTFPs as biocultural keystones to acknowledge and highlight their roles at broader scales. © 2018 by the author(s).","Culture; Food; Health; Keystone species; Nutrients; Pollination; Shelter","culture; ecosystem health; ecosystem service; food; keystone species; nontimber forest product; nutrient; pollination; shelter; Animalia",,,"Resilience Alliance",17083087,,,,"English","Ecol.

Several studies have shown that IVGs can improve postural control, gait, cognition, and functional independence in elderly people and patients with neurological disease. However, there is a lack of evidence about the effects of IVGs on frail and pre-frail elderly people. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of playing Nintendo Wii Fit Plus™ (NWFP) interactive video games, and the functional outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, mood, and fear of falling) in frail and pre-frail older adults. Methods: This study is a randomized controlled, parallel-group, feasibility trial. Participants were frail and pre-frail older adults randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG, n = 15) or control group (CG, n = 15). Participants in the EG performed 14 training sessions, lasting 50 min each, twice a week. In each training session, participants played five of 10 selected games, with two attempts at each game. Participants in the CG received general advice regarding the importance of physical activity. All participants were assessed on three occasions by a blinded physical therapist: before and after intervention, and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We assessed the feasibility (score of participants in the games), acceptability (game satisfaction questionnaire), safety (adverse events during training sessions), and functional outcomes: (1) postural control (Mini-BESTest); (2) gait (Functional Gait Assessment); (3) cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment); (4) mood (GDS-15); and (5) fear of falling (FES-I). Results: Participants in the EG improved their scores in all 10 games, reported that they understood and enjoyed the tasks of the games, and presented few adverse events during the practice. There was a significant improvement in the Mini-BESTest and Functional Gait Assessment in the EG when compared with the CG (p &lt; 0.05).

Drawing on a dataset of >135,000 trees from the Peruvian Amazon, we assessed its manifestation in biomass accumulation and seed production of Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) which plays a keystone role in carbon sequestration and NTFP harvesting in Amazonia. For the first time, we find both negative and positive effects of conspecific proximity on seed production and above ground biomass at small and large nearest neighbour distances, respectively. Plausible explanations for negative effects at small distances are fine-scale genetic structuring and competition for shared resources, whereas positive effects at large distances are likely due to increasing pollen limitation and suboptimal growth conditions. Finally, findings suggest that most field plots in Amazonia used for estimating carbon storage are too small to account for distance and density-dependent effects and hence may be inadequate for measuring species-centric ecosystem services. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"article; biomass; Brazil nut; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; competition; drawing; human; human experiment; nonhuman; seed production; Bertholletia; biomass; Brazil; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; physiology; plant seed; statistical model; tree; Bertholletia; Biomass; Brazil; Ecosystem; Linear Models; Seeds; Trees","Thomas, E.; Bioversity InternationalPeru; email: evert.thomas@gmail.com",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,"30076317","English","Sci.

Empirical evidence of such supply abnormalities has been found for some open-access fish species but not yet for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). We describe the theory of the backward-bending long-run supply and how such a supply relationship could produce multiple market equilibria, affecting regulatory outcomes. An empirical example is provided to test the theory in the case of wild American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius), which has been subjected to habitat loss and harvest pressure since the 18th Century and now has its exports regulated. We find evidence that quantities supplied are negatively related to price in the long run, indicating that harvest pressure is restricting wild ginseng harvestable stocks. Also, we find that a federal regulation banning exports of roots from plants under five years old, in effect since 1999, coincided with a reduction of supply. This result could be due to the slow natural rate of population recovery. © 2018","American ginseng; International trade; Nontimber forest products; Policy; Simultaneous equations","Harvesting; International trade; Natural resources; Public policy; Timber; American ginseng; Biological constraints; Empirical case studies; Federal regulations; Multiple markets; Non-timber forest products; Panax quinquefolius; Simultaneous equations; Reforestation; Bending; Foreign Trade; Forest Products; Harvesting; Natural Resources; Pressure; Reforestation; Supply","Frey, G.E.; USDA Forest Service, P.O.

However, studies on the importance of NTFPs to rural communities are often limited to a few select sites and are conducted in areas that are already known to have high rates of NTFP use. To address this, we examined the role of geographic and household level variables in determining whether a household would report collecting wild foods and other nonfood NTFP across 25 agro-ecological landscapes in Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Ghana. The aim of this study was to contribute to the literature on NTFP collection in Africa and to better understand where people depend on these resources by drawing on a broad range of sites that were highly variable in geographic characteristics as well as rates of NTFP collection to provide a better understanding of the determinants of NTFP collection. We found that geographic factors, such as the presence of forests, non-forest natural areas like grasslands and shrublands, and lower population density significantly predict whether a household will report collecting NTFP, and that these factors have greater explanatory power than household characteristics © 2018 The Authors","Africa; Forests; Geographic determinants; Household surveys; Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs); Wild foods","Food supply; Forestry; Population statistics; Surveys; Africa; Forests; Geographic determinants; Household surveys; Non-timber forest products; Wild food; Rural areas; Africa; Characteristics; Collection; Food; Forestry; Forests; Sites; Surveys","Cooper, M.; Conservation International, 2011 Crystal Drive #500, United States; email: mattcoop@terpmail.umd.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Regional markets for non-timber forest products (NTFPs) could both help rural people generate income from forests and raise urban awareness of forest benefits. We assess the urban market for NTFPs in Belém do Pará, the largest metropolitan area in the Brazilian Amazon, through a survey of consumers in 2006 – 2009. We segmented the urban consumer market in order to explore patterns in consumption and knowledge about NTFPs. We find that the market segments that consume the greatest number of NTFPs were characterized by relatively higher income and education as well as more recent migration to Belém. This suggests that demand for non-timber forest products does not fade with improved socioeconomic status. However, environmental education is needed to convert this demand into recognition of the benefits provided by forests, as many consumers are not aware that the products they consume come from the forest. In the two largest consumer segments, most consumers could not spontaneously list any forest product they consume, even though when a list of NTFPs was presented, many (>75%) indicated that they did consume the two most popular forest products: açaí palm fruit (Euterpe oleraceae) and Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa). Consumers in these largest segments have lower incomes, are more likely to have been born in Belém and are less likely to have completed postsecondary education. In addition to not recognizing that they consume forest products, many of these consumers had no direct experience of the forest: less than half of the survey respondents in these segments reported that they had ever visited the forest, despite living in a city located in the midst of the largest tropical forest in the world. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Created in 1990, the Reserve is named after rubber tapper and union leader Francisco “Chico” Mendes, who was assassinated by ranchers in 1988. The concept of the extractive reserve, a type of sustainable-use protected area, was conceived by rubber tappers to secure land rights and to protect the forests from which they derived their livelihoods. Thirty years since its creation, non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction maintains a critical role in CMER resident livelihoods, but it is now one of multiple and dynamic trajectories of income generating activities in the CMER. The state government has promoted sustainable development policies aimed at productive and multiple use of forests, including community-based timber management (CBTM). Concomitantly, the scale and scope of small-scale cattle ranching reflecting a growing “cowboy culture” pervasive in Eastern Acre is growing. These forces have brought sociocultural changes to the reserve as CMER residents engage these intertwined trajectories to improve their livelihoods. This article explores the trajectories of multiple development strategies in the CMER. We do this by revisiting and expanding on the principal themes of research of the co-authors – NTFP extraction, cattle ranching, and CBTM. Increasingly diverse CMER households demand multiple pathways to improve livelihoods, and these trajectories have created new economic opportunities for reserve residents. Although the NTFP sector has experienced some success in market development and valued-added initiatives, investments have not produced a sustainable and diversified extractive sector. Cattle ranching and CBTM have provided economic benefits to reserve residents’ livelihoods, but they have also created internal tensions across the social movement and governments agencies. A strategic vision is required that brings diverse government, non-government and reserve residents together and articulates how these dynamic, linked, and sometimes conflicting trajectories can synergize within a balanced, diversified livelihood framework to ensure long-term sustainability of the CMER. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

However, the importance of NTFPs have been recognized only recently. NTFPs form more than 5% of Nepal's national gross domestic product and are facing threat due to anthropogenic drivers and changing climate. Understanding of the current distribution and future dynamics of NTFPs is essential for effective conservation planning and management. In the maiden attempt, we used the Maxent model to understand the current and predict the future distribution by 2050 of 10 major NTFPs in Chitwan Annapurna Landscape, Nepal. The prediction accuracy of the models calculated based on the area under curve was high (> 90%) and the prediction by 2050 highlights potential increase in distribution range of seven NTFPs and potential decrease in that of three NTFPs in the study area.

Are considered as belonging to the NTFP designation all those products extracted from the forest which is not wood, such as leaves, fruits, fibers, seeds, oils, resins, gums and others. This market has been poorly explored in the country. This study discusses the market for NTFP in the Amazon region. This study aims to measure the response of the extractive supply of NTFP to price changes during the period 1973-2011. We used econometric tools for the analysis, where the supply and demand equations were specified and adjusted by the Ordinary Least Squares method. The price response was measured by the estimation of two logarithmic models for each of the products. Simultaneous models of supply and demand for NTFPs were developed and used to explain the behavior of this market. The results showed low price elasticity for the supply, which means that the quantity produced showed a low response to price. Our findings imply that the NTFP market in the Amazon shows economic potential, although it requires investments in regional infrastructure for production, training, and organization of extractive communities, and marketing support. Our results have important implications for policymakers to formulate effective subsidy policies to encourage the commercial production of NTFPs and to strengthen the NTFP market in the region. © 2018, Southern Cross Publishing.","Amazon rainforest; Economics; Sustainability",,"Vasconcelos, P.G.A.; Department of Forestry Engeneering, Brazil; email: pedroguilherme.av@gmail.com",,"Southern Cross Publishing",18352693,,,,"English","Aust.

Research has centered on regulation services with little research in support services such as nursery habitat and provisioning of non-timber forest products (NTFP). We evaluate structural characteristics of 210 trees of ten species of ecological importance from a Colombian oak forest and their relation to Philodendron longirrhizum (Araceae) and its production of aerial roots to obtain fibers. This species was present in the majority of forest tree species, the structural characteristics of the trees were not distinguished between hosts and non-hosts and the rugosity of the bark and diameter of the trunk of the host species influenced the number of total and harvestable roots. The nursery habitat offered by the oak forest results from the mechanism that P. longirrhizum uses to climb over a wide variety of hosts, and the provisioning service is fostered by larger host trees that favor the production of roots. For the management of P. longirrhizum we suggest the establishment of individuals over the majority of trees if the aim is the enrichment and the establishment of individuals on larger trees if the aim is to increase the production of fiber. © 2018 The Authors","Aerial root fiber; Ecosystem services; Harvesting; Host tree; Non-timber forest products; Philodendron longirrhizum",,"López-Camacho, R.; Facultad del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Carrera 5 Este N° 15 – 82, Colombia; email: rlopezc@udistrital.edu.co",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

This paper emphasized the need to develop actions under the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) with measurable results up to 2020, regarding the status and perspectives related to Targets 12 and 13, focusing on the Brazilian context in order to identify gaps and actions to achieve the goals for conservation and sustainable use of plants. It should be noted that Target 12 also covers logging, not necessarily directly related to indigenous peoples and traditional communities, but may threaten their livelihoods. In Brazil, scientific knowledge about the ecological effects of the harvesting of non-timber forest products is still limited, and few studies have contributed to the establishment of legal regulations for collection and management. With regard to target 13, which concerns traditional and indigenous knowledge about plant use and the dependence of these peoples on plants, there are still a lack of integrative and effective policy initiatives. However, considering the negative political context of recent decades and exacerbated in recent years in relation to biodiversity conservation and indigenous peoples and local communities, profound changes are necessary in the Brazilian scenario, with strong support and recognition for indigenous peoples and local communities, so that any objective related to the achievement of the goals of the GSPC is minimally achieved. © 2018 Instituto de Pesquisas Jardim Botanico do Rio de Janeiro.

The fruits of these species are rich in vitamin C and are used in the preparation of a number of herbal medicines for treating a wide range of disorders. Due to the increased demand, they have been harvested extensively and form a major source of income for the forest-dwelling communities living in southern India. There are limited studies to understand the impact of harvesting on the genetic structure of these species. In this study, 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers have been developed for P. emblica and were characterized by screening 20 individuals each of P. emblica and P. indofischeri. The number of alleles per locus ranged 2–9 for P. emblica and 2–11 for P. indofischeri. The observed and expected heterozygosity of P. emblica ranged 0–1 and 0.401–0.825, respectively.

When regulation and enforcement are minimal, economic incentives for low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use can provide conservation and livelihood benefits. One management option for promoting low intensity and non-deleterious forest use includes the harvest and production of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). This research identifies and examines strategies to promote sustainable livelihoods in a conservation landscape. We assess Pangkalan Bulian Village, Musi Banyuasin District, South Sumatra Province using the Community Livelihood Appraisal and Product Scanning (CLAPS) method to describe potential commodities and conduct value chain and market analyses on downstream sectors. Data collection included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and household surveys disseminated through snowball sampling. We find that rattan is a priority NTFP due to the presence of abundant raw materials, trained human resources, and potential markets. Actors involved along the value chain are collectors, local brokers, large collectors, small processors, large processors, retailers and end consumers. Profit margins earned along each link of the value chain are around 25%. Thus, we encourage rattan harvest and production as a low-intensity and non-deleterious forest use that can simultaneously benefit local livelihoods and forest conservation in a landscape where protected area rules and regulations are difficult to enforce. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity conservation; Forest management units; Livelihoods improvement; NTFPs utilization","Biodiversity; Chains; Commerce; Conservation; Environmental protection; Raw materials; Surveys; Timber; Biodiversity conservation; Forest conservation; Forest management units; In-depth interviews; Livelihoods improvement; Non-timber forest products; Rules and regulations; Sustainable livelihood; Forestry; Biodiversity; Chains; Commerce; Conservation; Raw Materials; Surveys","Nurrochmat, D.R.; Department of Forest Management, Indonesia; email: dnurrochmat@ipb.ac.id",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

In this study, we sought to better understand the scale and scope of M. flexuosa fruit harvest in the Peruvian Amazon, the destructive harvest of which has caused conservation concern for decades, by collecting data on the amounts and origins of the fruit entering the city of Iquitos, Peru – making harvest patterns spatially and temporally explicit for the first time. We achieved this by examining shipping logs and monitoring key ports and bus lines. During one year, we recorded 227 943 sacks (8206 mT) of fruit entering Iquitos, originating from at least 267 communities across the region's major watersheds. A large proportion of fruit originated from communities in the Medio Bajo Marañón and Tigre watersheds which consistently sent high volumes of fruit to Iquitos from November through March. However, from May through August a greater number of communities with frequent, low volume extraction in the Amazonas, Bajo Amazonas, and Napo watersheds contributed most fruit. It appears that this spatio-temporal shift in the exportation points of fruit reflects regional variation in fruiting phenology of M. flexuosa across the region. Finer scale trends could be influenced by social and market factors, especially market access as influenced by ship routes. The massive region-wide extraction that we report for this ecologically important NTFP has many potential ramifications for ecological change and carbon sequestration which warrant further study. Factors impacting extraction patterns as well as potential ecological consequences need to be properly examined before promoting NTFP extraction. © 2018","Aguaje; Amazon conservation; Natural resources; Non-timber forest product; Regional harvest; Spatially-explicit extraction","conservation; fruit; harvesting; natural resource; nontimber forest product; perennial plant; spatiotemporal analysis; sustainability; Amazon Basin; Iquitos; Loreto; Peru; Mauritia flexuosa","Horn, C.M.; Institute for Conservation Research, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Road, United States; email: chorn@sandiegozoo.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",01436228,,,,"English","Appl.

We analyzed the abundance of tree species providing NTFPs, recognized by local H'mong people, in both the strictly protected core zone and the low-intensity forest use buffer zone in north-western Vietnam. We identified 249 tree species, of which 48% were classified as NTFP species. The abundance of 35% of the NTFP tree species was significantly correlated with footpaths, indicating an influence of human activity. A multiple logistic regression model indicates that using NTFP trees for food, medicine, and root harvesting, increases the probability of an NTFP tree absence in the buffer zone. In contrast, the high density of species, and collections of fruit, leaf, and resin decrease the probability of an NTFP tree absence in the buffer zone. Further assessment with a logistic model indicated that NTFP use has lower impacts on the tree community than timber use.

Alongside the increased popularity and commercial use of NWFPs, their yields are also more often taken into account in forest management planning. Empirical yield models recently developed for different NWFPs enable forest managers to include their predicted yields in multi-objective optimization. However, knowledge on the synergies and trade-offs between timber production and different NWFPs is scanty. In this study, we analyzed these relationships through correlation matrices and production possibility frontiers in two case study forest holdings from Finland. A large number of Pareto optimal forest holding level plans were produced by multi-objective optimization and used to analyze trade-offs and synergies. Empirical yield models for 12 NWFPs, representing different berries, mushrooms, and tree-based products, were utilized in the analyses. The results revealed synergies and possibilities for joint-production for NWFPs, but also trade-offs between NWFPs and timber production. NWFPs often had a negative correlation with cutting removals, with the only exception being cowberry. Despite the overall negative correlation, the maximum yields of NWFPs called for some cuttings. Negative correlations with the net present value of timber production were weaker. The results are valuable when the aim is to diversify the use of boreal forests and open avenues for truly multi-objective decision support services to facilitate the decision making of forest owners. © 2018 by the authors.","Multi-objective forestmanagement; Non-wood forest products; Production possibility frontier","Commerce; Decision making; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Timber; Correlation matrix; Forest management planning; Multi objective; Multiobjective decision; Negative correlation; Non-wood forest products; Production possibility frontier; Timber production; Forestry; boreal forest; decision making; forest management; forest product; forestry production; growth rate; trade-off; Commerce; Consumption; Correlation; Decision Making; Forestry; Optimization; Production; Basidiomycota; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","Kurttila, M.; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Yliopistokatu 6, Finland; email: mikko.kurttila@luke.fi",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050186946

Addressing these issues through the commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has been widely researched, tested, and discussed. While the evidence is inconclusive, there is growing understanding of what works and why, and this paper examines the acknowledged success and failure factors. African forest honey has been relatively overlooked as an NTFP, an oversight this paper addresses. Drawing on evidence from a long-established forest conservation, livelihoods, and trade development initiative in SW Ethiopia, forest honey is benchmarked against accepted success and failure factors and is found to be a near-perfect NTFP. The criteria are primarily focused on livelihood impacts and consequently this paper makes recommendations for additional criteria directly related to forest maintenance. © 2018, The Author(s).","Beekeeping; Ethiopia; Forest conservation; Honey; Livelihoods; NTFP","Conservation; Deforestation; Developing countries; Beekeeping; Ethiopia; Forest conservation; Honey; Livelihoods; NTFP; Food products; apiculture; commercialization; deforestation; developing world; forest ecosystem; forest edge; forest management; honey; nontimber forest product; apiculture; article; drawing; Ethiopia; forest; honey; human; human experiment; apiculture; economics; environmental protection; Ethiopia; forestry; growth, development and aging; honey; procedures; tree; trends; Ethiopia; Beekeeping; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethiopia; Forestry; Forests; Honey; Humans; Trees","Meaton, J.; Huddersfield Business School, United Kingdom; email: j.meaton@hud.ac.uk",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"29520438","English","Environ.

Participatory mapping combining GPS coordinates and interviews was carried out with 5 female and 5 male collectors in each of two villages within or adjacent to the logging concession. Precommercial and harvestable (&gt;70 cm dbh) Ozigo and Abam trees, as well as their stumps, were also quantified on 20 five ha plots in the 2012 cutting area of the concession and on 21 five ha plots on 10 km transects from each village. Distances to 59 Abam and 75 Ozigo from which fruits were collected ranged from 0.7 to 4.46 Km from the village centres. Most collections were by mixed groups made up of men, women and children (54%) at an average of 1.21 ± 0.09 km; or by men and women (18%) at 2.21 ± 0.15 km; or women and children (14%) at 4.03 ± 0.22 km from the village. Almost 28% of all of the collection trees were inside the logging concession boundaries but outside the village agricultural zone, 43% were inside the village agricultural zone, and 29% were outside the logging concession. Only 33% of Ozigo collection trees had reached commercial size while 75% of Abam trees had. No stumps were found on any sample plots, probably reflecting the ban on felling Ozigo which was in effect at the time; and the relatively low commercial value of Abam. Densities of precommercial Ozigo trees in the cutting area were more than double their densities around the villages (236.0 ± 20.3100 ha−1and 96.6 ± 17.2100 ha−1, respectively), while densities of harvestable Ozigo trees were 7 times higher in the cutting area than around villages (120 ± 20.2100 ha−1and 17.1 ± 3.4100 ha−1respectively). This probably reflects past and current anthropogenic pressures around the villages, including logging and land clearance for agricultural fields. Densities of precommercial Abam were almost four times higher around the village (22.3 ± 5.6 and 6.0 ± 2.9) than on the cutting area. Villagers did not record a decline in availability of or access to these fruits over the past 5 years, suggesting little or no immediate conflict between timber production and access to fruits from these trees. © 2018","Congo Basin; Dacryodes buettneri; Forest fruits; Gambeya lacourtiana; NTFP; Timber concessions",,"Taedoumg, H.; Bioversity International, P.O.

Beside their effects on biodiversity, these practices should also promote non-timber forest products (NTFPs). We assessed: (1) how prescribed burning and tree retention influence NTFPs by examining the production of bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus and cowberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea; (2) if there are synergies or trade-offs in the delivery of these NTFPs in relation to the delivery of species richness, focusing on five groups of forest-dwelling species. We used a long-term experiment located in eastern Finland, with three different harvesting treatments: clear-cut logging, logging with retention patches and unlogged, which were combined with or without prescribed burning. Eleven years after the treatment application, we scored plant cover and berry production in different microhabitats within these treatments, while species richness data for five species groups (ground layer lichens and bryophytes, vascular plants, saproxylic beetles, pollinators—here bees and hoverflies) were collected at the stand level. Logging favoured cowberry production, particularly for plants growing in the vicinity of stumps. Logging was detrimental for cover and berry production of bilberry. Retention mitigated these negative effects slightly, but cover and berry production were still substantially lower compared to unlogged forests. Prescribed burning increased the cowberry production in retention patches and in unlogged forest. Bilberry production decreased with burning, except in unlogged forest where the effect was neutral. No single management treatment simultaneously favoured all values—NTFPs and richness—and trade-offs among values were common. Only bilberry production and beetle diversity were higher under retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, compared to logged stands. Prescribed burning favoured many values when performed in combination with retention forestry, or in unlogged stands, but different treatment combinations favoured different species groups. Synthesis and applications. Our results demonstrate that widely applied conservation practices in managed boreal forests are unlikely to benefit all ecosystem values everywhere. If high multifunctionality is desired, managing at a landscape scale, countering the local trade-offs among values, may be more appropriate than the stand-scale conservation practices commonly practiced today. © 2018 The Authors.

The local environment is an excellent habitat for a wide variety of edible fungi. In addition, the region is home to many ethnic minorities and especially the Yi ethnic group who has a long history for traditionally using fungi as food or medicine. The aims of this review are to provide up-to-date information on the knowledge about, and traditional management of, fungi in this area and give advice on future utilization and conservation. Methods: Field surveys and in-depth semi-structured interviews were used to gather data. Ethnomycological data was collected from 67 informants in the summer of 2015. Results: Twenty-two edible fungal species were recorded both as food or non-timber forest products (NTFPs), used to increase income, and the importance of this resource for the Yi ethnic group was evaluated. Conclusion: Abundant and diverse wild genetic resources and a large production chain of edible fungi were recorded in Chuxiong. However, because of over-harvesting, the wild edible fungi are facing increasing threats. Suggestions are proposed to allow sustainable use of fungi resources, including (1) promotion of diversification of transportation, (2) development of fungi cultivation to improve quality and supply and reduce harvest pressure, (3) improvement of public awareness for environmental protection and sustainable development, and (4) promotion of eco-tourism and development of fungi catering in rural agro- and slow-food tourism. © 2018 The Author(s).","Edible fungi; Ethnobotany; Market; Production chain; Sustainability","article; awareness; catering service; China; environmental protection; ethnic group; ethnobotany; field study; forest; genetic resource; human; market; semi structured interview; summer; sustainable development; tourism; biodiversity; China; fungus; growth, development and aging; Biodiversity; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethnobotany; Fungi","Liu, B.; Minzu University of China, China; email: boliu@muc.edu.cn",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17464269,,,"29907156","English","J.

Our analysis focuses on gathering in three spaces: parks, yards, and public rights of way. We present a framework for conceptualizing access, and highlight cognitive mechanisms of access associated with foragers’ internal moral judgments about harvesting. Key findings are: (1) internal moral calculations about whether it is right or wrong to harvest a particular NTFP in a particular place are an important but previously unacknowledged mechanism governing resource access; and (2) these calculations may help prevent over-harvesting of NTFPs, which are common pool resources, in urban environments where social and environmental conditions lend themselves to a de facto situation of open access. Our findings suggest that voluntary codes of conduct may be the best way to manage NTFP access in cities. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Access; common pool resources; foraging; nontimber forest products; tenure; urban forestry","accessibility; conceptual framework; harvesting; natural resource; nontimber forest product; tenure system; urban area; urban forestry; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]","Charnley, S.; USDA Forest Service, 620 SW Main Street, United States; email: scharnley@fs.fed.us",,"Routledge",08941920,,,,"English","Soc.

Whereas in tropical countries much attention has been given to the role of NWFPs as a basic livelihood asset, in European countries the focus is increasingly oriented on NWFPs as niche-marketed products or as well-being products embedded in recreation and pedagogic services. Four main development orientations may be distinguished. These are not uniformly distributed over Europe. Depending on socio-economic, cultural and ecological conditions five European regions with different characteristics in respect to NWFP use and development are identified. © 2018 Commonwealth Forestry Association. arights reserved.","non-wood forest products; regional variation; service-based economy; socio-cultural transformation; well-being","cultivation; livelihood; nontimber forest product; product development; regional economy; tropical region; Europe",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Our results show that, at the scale of the Brazilian Amazon, associations between recreational ecosystem services and extractivist activities of Brazil nut and rubber are very weak with no significant differences regarding Brazil nut (p = 0.61) and rubber (p = 0.41) income across the different tourism development classes. However, qualitative analysis of the case studies reveals that where there are multifunctional livelihoods, recreational ecosystem services are indeed helping to enhance non timber forest product extractivist social values that otherwise would be suppressed by prevailing “cattle ranching” lifestyles. We therefore support innovative ways to make both recreational ecosystem services and non timber forest products extraction not merely a juxtaposition of activities, but integrated into multifunctional livelihoods. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brazilian Amazon; Community based tourism; Ecosystem services mapping; Extractivist landscapes; Non timber forest products; Sustainable livelihood valuation",,"Carvalho Ribeiro, S.M.; Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Av.

The present study aims at examining how local communities have changed their ways of NTFP utilization in the Parah forest after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a national park in the year 2009. Methodology: A questionnaire survey was conducted using 150 randomly selected households from four villages bordering the Parah forest, Khao Nan National Park. The questionnaires were divided into two categories: socio-economics and NTFP utilization. The socio-economics of the interviewees were composed of gender, age group, marital status, education level, number of members/household, principle occupation and level of income. Income was categorized into three income categories, which ranged from poor (<334 $/month), moderate (334-500 $/month) and rich (>500 $/month), based on the Thailand minimum daily wage. NTFP utilization composed of type of NTFP, harvested quantity and harvesting frequency. Results: NTFPs from the Parah forest were used by 74.67 % of villagers. No differences in the amount of all NTFPs obtained in 2007 and 2015 were found. However, the price of NTFPs has increased over the years, and so the value of NTFPs in the Parah forest in 2015 reached 2,773.36 US Dollars/household, which was much higher than that reported in 2007. The frequency of the NTFPs that were harvested by villagers, ranked from highest to lowest, were as follows: Parah seeds, honey, stink bean fruits (Parkia speciosa), fruits of Archidendron spp., termite mushrooms (Termitomyces spp.), fruits of Parkia javanica, medicinal plants, jiringa fruits (Archidendron jiringa), fruits of Sandoricum koetjape and bamboo shoots. The harvesting quantityofNTFPsdidnotchange after Khao Nan National Park was designated as a National Parkintheyear2009. Interpretation: The existence of a variety of Parah NTFPs are of great importance to the villagers; therefore future planning is needed for conservation and sustainable utilization. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).","Khao Nan National Park; NTFP utilization; Parah forest; Socio-economics","bamboo; conservation planning; conservation status; crop plant; forest ecosystem; forest product; fruit; harvesting; national park; nontimber forest product; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; socioeconomic conditions; Khao Nan National Park; Nakhon Si Thammarat [Southern Region]; Southern Region; Southern Region; Thailand; Archidendron; Basidiomycota; Isoptera; Parkia javanica; Parkia speciosa; Termitomyces","Jaroensutasinee, M.; Centre of Excellence for Ecoinformatics, Thailand; email: mullica.jn@gmail.com",,"Triveni Enterprises",02548704,,JEBID,,"English","J.

However, the successful implementation and sustainability of such initiatives depends on resource users’ willingness to engage. Some studies claim that resource users will only participate and invest their time in management when the financial benefits received exceed the costs. However, evidence suggests that people cooperate and may volunteer even when not directly rewarded. We evaluated whether economic benefits earned from resource exploitation or cooperative behavior better explained the likelihood of people's voluntary participation in monitoring. We studied an Amazonian forest community in Brazil, who harvested and traded a commercially-important non-timber forest product (NTFP), and gathered data using the following procedures: a survey applied to 166 adults in order to estimate people's NTFP dependence, cooperative behavior and intention to engage in monitoring tasks; and the implementation of pilot-monitoring tasks to observe who participated. Based on mixed-effects regressions, the results indicated that both factors can predict intended and actual participation, although cooperative behavior was a stronger and more consistent predictor. Thus, fostering community cooperation may outcompete financial benefits in ensuring engagement in natural resource management. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Community-based management; Non-timber forest products; Participatory monitoring; Pro-environmental behavior","community resource management; cooperative behavior; cost; environmentalism; exploitation; monitoring; natural resource; nontimber forest product; participatory approach; resource management; sustainability; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil","Brites, A.D.; Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz, Av.

The main rationale of private forest management is to maximise profits from timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) production. From a social point of view an under-supply of positive forest externalities (or non-marketed ecosystem services) exists. This paper therefore contributes to the ecosystem service (ES) literature by assessing the production cost structure, in other words, the cost of marketed production and provision of carbon and biodiversity, based on a survey of private forest owners in Hoa Binh Province in Vietnam. The econometric analysis was carried out using a dual cost function approach to analyse the trade-off between forestry costs and ecological performance. This is, to our knowledge, the first time such an approach has been used to estimate the production relationship between marketed outputs and non-marketed ES in the forest sector. This approach appears to be appropriate for handling the multiple joint outputs of forest production and allows us to estimate marginal costs and other cost measures such as cost complementarities in the production of multiple ES. Our results indicate that there is complementarity in the provision of timber and carbon sequestration and, consequently, policies that enhance carbon sequestration in private forests in Vietnam can be implemented without additional costs for the forest owner. We also found that keeping deadwood (to favour biodiversity) had no significant cost and was complementary with NTFP (also an indicator of biodiversity in our study), but could increase the marginal cost of producing timber. This means that biodiversity can be enhanced at no additional cost, provided that the quantity of deadwood does not significantly increase. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Cost complementarity; Forest ecosystem service; Marginal cost; Trade-off; Translog cost function; Vietnam","biodiversity; competitiveness; complementarity; cost analysis; ecological economics; econometrics; ecosystem service; environmental planning; forest ecosystem; nontimber forest product; prioritization; service provision; trade-off; Hoa Binh; Viet Nam","Lambini, C.K.; Bayreuth Centre for Ecology and Environmental Research, Germany; email: cosmas.lambini@bvng.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

The current studies profile the carbon storage of cocoa agroforests in Southern Cameroon by: (1) evaluating the carbon stocks of cocoa agroforests in different ecological zones (Yaoundé, Mbalmayo, and Ebolowa), (2) evaluating the carbon stocks of cocoa agroforests under different management methods, (3) evaluating the contribution of some plant species to carbon sequestration inside cocoa agroforests, and (4) identifying the carbon stocks of some important species. Inside the cocoa agroforests of Southern Cameroon, associated plants store around 70% of the carbon. Cocoa agroforests with timber and NWFP (Non-Wood Forest Products) store more than twice what is found in systems rich with Musa and oil palm. In these systems, timber and NWFP store more than 2.5 times what is found in cocoa systems with high densities of cocoa, and such systems with timber and NWFP store more than 3.3 times the carbon of unshaded cocoa orchards. Among the companion plants, high value timber and edible NWFP contribute, respectively, to 30% and 10% of carbon storage by plants associated with cocoa. While the top ten plant species generally store more than half of what is found in associated plants, none of the species (except Terminalia superba in the Yaoundé Region) store more than 10% of what is found in associated plants. The proximity to market or remoteness and closeness to forest impact on this percentage. Using cocoa agroforests for climate change mitigation needs to take in consideration the utility and management of associated plants. In this perspective of climate change mitigation, beside biodiversity conservation, other co-benefits mainly related to the livelihood provided by cocoa agroforests need to be taken into consideration. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.","Cacao; Carbon stock; Climate change mitigation; Cocoa agroforest; Forest landscape; NWFP; REDD+; Timber",,"Sonwa, D.J.; CIFOR (Center for International Forestry Research)Cameroon; email: d.sonwa@cgiar.org",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811076503; 9789811076497,,,"English","Agrofor.: Anecdotal to Mod.

Policymakers expect that Tenure Reform could also stimulate households to engage in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) production in Protection Project regions. However, only a few studies have investigated the effect of Tenure Reform on household NTFP production in Protection Project regions. To fill this gap, we built an integrative conceptual framework and estimated a corresponding structural equation model (SEM) using survey data from 932 households in Protection Project regions in southwestern China. In our research framework, there are four factors, including household characteristics, labour and social capital, forestland characteristics, and the Tenure Reform, affecting household NTFP production. The results substantiate that Tenure Reform has had a significant positive effect on household NTFP production. Additionally, household and forestland characteristics have promoted household NTFP production, but quantitatively less than Tenure Reform. This report can be used to inform the government that future investment in Tenure Reform still needs to be enhanced, and policy enforcement still needs to be strengthened. © 2018 by the authors.","China; Collective forest tenure reform; Households; Natural forest protection project; Non-timber forest products production; Structural equation model","collective action; conceptual framework; forest management; forestry production; governance approach; household income; investment; nontimber forest product; numerical model; policy implementation; policy reform; tenure system; China","Yao, S.; Research Center for Resource Economics and Environment Management, No. 3 Taicheng Road, China; email: yaoshunbo@nwafu.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045051121

Therefore, this study sought to determine the factors and rationale behind the setting of prices for selected NTFPs in 15 different areas of South Africa. The results showed that the pricing factors considered by sellers when setting the prices of NTFP varied with the type of NTFP being sold, type of market (home markets or urban markets) and the method used by the seller to procure the stock. Overall, transport costs, stock price, profit margin, time taken to collect or produce the product and market price were the widely used factors to determine prices for NTFPs.

This paper discuss a NTFPs production and marketing chain (Mauritia flexuosa fruits) in Abaetetuba County, Northern Brazil. Research was carried out using the following methods: participant observation, application of semi-structured questionnaires, and by accompanying production during harvest months in 2015. Data show that this channel is made up of many actors, including riverine people (ribeirinhos), middlemen and merchants in Abaetetuba and other regions in Amazonia. Fruits are sold through short distribution channels in Abaetetuba, contributing to up to 80% of all income produced by ribeirinhos during winter months; miriti income ranges from 918.00USD to 2006.00USD per household per harvest depending on the distribution channel used. These values are equivalent to those obtained from acai (Euterpe oleracea) sales obtained by acai producers who employ moderate management levels in Amazonia, a fact that leads ribeirinhos to consider miriti the “winter acai”. The importance of miriti fruit and product sales for households in the study area is striking, and as such, policies to strengthen NTFP value chains are in great demand. © 2018","Amazonia; Extractivism; Local markets; Non-timber forest products; Tropical forest",,"Sousa, F.F.D.; Federal Institute of Education, Brazil; email: fagner.sousa@ifpa.edu.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

The sale of NTFPs was the third most common coping strategy, after kinship and agricultural adjustments. Coping strategies differed between sites and type of shock. © The Authors 2017.

We conducted surveys and used the Gini index to compute the contribution of income earned from (1) agriculture, (2) forest-related resources, and (3) self-employment and wages, and to assess the income inequality of households in the study sites. The Gini index of the total income from three clusters of income generating activities was 0.45. Cluster 1: agricultural production was the largest source of income (Gini = 0.30). The share of income from Cluster 2 (Gini index = 0.49), from community forestry and sustainable resource management, including hunting, NTFP collection, selling low quality timber, and plantation farming, contributed an important supplement to reduce income inequality and poverty. Income from Cluster 3 (Gini = 0.93) was highly unequal across the study sites. The indigenous poor remain dependent on forest products for daily food consumption and for additional income. The study suggests that policy makers should urgently consider supporting community forestry and community protected areas by integrating them with payment for ecosystem services.

They also host edible caterpillars, Imbrasia oyemensis and Cirina forda, respectively, which are important to the nutrition and income of rural and urban populations. This study evaluated the density of these tree species within a 10 km radius around each of 4 villages and in the 2012 annual cutting areas of two timber concessions in the region of Kisangani (DRC). Sapelli and tali trees ≥20 cm dbh and their stumps were identified and measured on 21 five ha plots around each village and 20 five ha plots on each concession. Around villages and on concessions, sapelli trees occurred at densities of 0.048 ± 0.008 harvestable trees (≥80 cm dbh) ha−1 and 0.135 ± 0.019 precommercial trees ha−1. Harvestable tali trees (≥60 cm dbh) were seven times more abundant at 0.347 ± 0.032 ha−1, while precommercial tali trees occurred at densities of 0.329 ± 0.033 trees ha−1. Between 25% and 40% of the harvestable sapelli trees had been logged as compared to &lt;3% of the harvestable tali trees. Production per tree, derived from another study, was extrapolated to estimate caterpillar yields on a half circle of 15,700 ha within 10 km of villages, using these estimates of tree densities. Depending on the village, yields were estimated as 11.6–34.5 Mg year−1 of I. oyemensis from sapelli trees, and 65.8–80.9 Mg year−1 of C. forda from tali trees, an average of 0.74–2.2 kg ha−1 year and 4.2–5.2 kg ha−1 year, fresh weight, respectively (0.23–0.68 kg ha−1 year−1 and 1.3–1.6 kg ha−1 year−1, dry weight, respectively). Harvestable trees yielded more caterpillars, providing most of the C. forda caterpillars. However, because harvestable sapelli trees occurred at low densities, the bulk of I. oyemensis caterpillar production would be hosted on precommercial trees. Logging practices that reject poorly formed or hollow trees and guidelines that call for high minimum diameter limits and retention of seed trees or prohibit logging on slopes or riparian zones, safeguard edible caterpillar production. Multiple resource management for multiple stakeholders would require more deliberate planning and management approaches based on negotiations with local communities and approaches like setting aside collection zones or collection trees that would be protected from logging. © 2017 The Authors","African mahogany; Cirina forda; Forest management; Imbrasia oyemensis; NTFP; Tropical forests","Logging (forestry); Rural areas; Timber; African mahogany; Cirina forda; Imbrasia oyemensis; NTFP; Tropical forest; Forestry; angiosperm; caterpillar; deciduous tree; forest management; forestry production; logging (timber); moth; tropical forest; Forest Management; Forests; Congo Basin; Democratic Republic Congo; Cirina forda; Entandrophragma cylindricum; Erythrophleum suaveolens; Imbrasia; Swietenia","Snook, L.K.; Bioversity International, Via dei Tre Denari 472/a, Maccarese, Italy; email: l.snook@cgiar.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The aim of our study was to measure the annual economic contribution of NTFPs to local livelihoods in two villages of south-eastern Burkina Faso, focusing on the following specific questions: What is the average share of NTFPs in local household income? Which socio-economic variables affect total household income and NTFP dependency? How does NTFP income vary between (i) villages, (ii) ethnic groups and (iii) different income groups? Does NTFP income have an equalising effect on income inequality? Applying structured household surveys, we investigated the economic contribution of NTFPs household revenues among 155 households. NTFPs accounted for the second largest income share (45 %) of total household income compared to other income sources, i.e. crop production, livestock breeding and off-farm activities. We found that poorer households depend more on income from NTFPs than wealthier households, even though the latter earned more from NTFPs in absolute terms. In general, income from NTFPs had an equalising effect on income inequality. Furthermore, we discovered significant differences in NTFP dependency between the two investigated villages and across the three main ethnic groups (Gourmantché, Mossi, Fulani) reflecting different species compositions in their surroundings as well as different traditional uses and harvesting practices. Thus, we argue that management recommendations for agroforestry systems and poverty alleviation need to consider local differences with regard to site-specific species composition as well as ethnic-specific NTFP use patterns and habits. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Household income; Non-timber forest products; NTFP dependency; Rural livelihood; Socio-economics; West Africa","crop production; economic conditions; ethnic group; habitat type; household income; management practice; nontimber forest product; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; village; Burkina Faso; West Africa","Leßmeister, A.; Institute of Ecology, Germany; email: annalessmeister@gmx.de",,"Springer Netherlands",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

There are few data available in Gabon to confirm this common assertion. This study was conducted on 127 households in 14 villages around two timber concessions in the south-eastern and south-western regions of Gabon for a period of one year. Conventional socio‐economic survey tools such as focus group discussions, census and semi-structured interviews with households were used for gathering the data. Results reveal that rural people depend on various sources of food and income for their livelihoods, but overall, the current contribution of NTFPs obtained from plant sources is insignificant compared to those from other activities. Odika (Irvingia gabonensis), ‘atanga sauvage’ (Dacryodes buettneri), fungus (Termitomyces spp.) and Gabon nut (Coula edulis) represent the main forest products commonly harvested by rural people. They are used primarily for subsistence, but the surplus is sold. The results of this study suggest that: (1) the main components of decree No. 137/PR/MEFP of February 4, 2009, that prohibits the logging of five multiple-use tree species over a period of 25 years in order to safeguard the sources of NTFPs, should be reviewed; and (2) state authorities and partners should promote projects aimed at increasing public awareness of the NTFP sector. These projects should include a census of NTFPs (for food, for medicine and for services), characterize their uses and identify the markets of target products as well as the development potential of NTFPs. Such projects could help Gabon and other Congo Basin countries to fix norms/standards for sustainable natural resource management and for enhancing the contribution of NTFPs to the national economy. This will be particularly relevant in the wake of dwindling oil revenues and the need to diversify and promote other revenue sources in the country. © 2017, The Author(s).","Governance; Household economy; Livelihoods; NTFPs; Policy; Rural people; State priorities","Dacryodes buettneri; Fungi; Irvingia gabonensis; Termitomyces","Iponga, D.M.; Institut de Recherche en Ecologie Tropicale (IRET), Gabon; email: dmiponga@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

As information on individual animals is often unavailable, livestock data may already be aggregated at the time of inventory analysis, both across individual animals and across seasons. Even though various computational tools exist to consider the effect of genetic and seasonal variabilities in livestock-originated emissions intensity, the degree to which these methods can address the bias suffered by representative animal approaches is not well-understood. Using detailed on-farm data collected on the North Wyke Farm Platform (NWFP) in Devon, UK, this paper proposes a novel approach of life cycle impact assessment that complements the existing LCA methodology. Field data, such as forage quality and animal performance, were measured at high spatial and temporal resolutions and directly transferred into LCA processes. This approach has enabled derivation of emissions intensity for each individual animal and, by extension, its intra-farm distribution, providing a step towards reducing uncertainty related to agricultural production inherent in LCA studies for food. Depending on pasture management strategies, the total emissions intensity estimated by the proposed method was higher than the equivalent value recalculated using a representative animal approach by 0.9–1.7 kg CO2-eq/kg liveweight gain, or up to 10% of system-wide emissions. This finding suggests that emissions intensity values derived by the latter technique may be underestimated due to insufficient consideration given to poorly performing animals, whose emissions becomes exponentially greater as average daily gain decreases. Strategies to mitigate life-cycle environmental impacts of pasture-based beef productions systems are also discussed. © 2017 The Author(s)","Beef production; Carbon footprint; Grazing systems; High-resolution data; Life Cycle Assessment; Uncertainty analysis","Agriculture; Animals; Beef; Carbon; Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Meats; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural productions; Beef production; Grazing systems; High resolution data; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment; Life-cycle environmental impact; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Life cycle","Takahashi, T.; Rothamsted Research, North Wyke, United Kingdom; email: taro.takahashi@rothamsted.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The data were collected in 2014 and 2015 through primary and secondary sources. Partial least squares (PLS) method was used to analysis the data. PLS is a modeling technique that features multiple regression and principal component analysis. The study shows that still a large number of indigenous households is involved in the NTFP activities. But the communities are moving away from NTFP based income to cash-crop based income because of poor sustainable forest management and lack of forest property rights. However, NTFP have a significant role in the household income and contribute 24% of the average income. Moreover, the analysis shows that location is significant to the poverty. There should be a suitable sustainable forest management system which can teach these indigenous communities about proper way of NTFP gathering and given proper rights to forest land. Furthermore, education is not significant to indigenous people and there is a high rate of school dropout among them. The government should introduce a different education system for indigenous communities which will emphasize the importance of education to them. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Demographic factor; Indigenous communities; Indigenous people; Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Orang Asli; Peninsular Malaysia; Poverty; Socioeconomic factor","cash cropping; demography; education; forest management; household income; indigenous population; nontimber forest product; poverty; socioeconomic indicator; sustainability; Malaysia; West Malaysia","Kari, F.B.; Department of Economics, Malaysia; email: fatimah_kari@um.edu.my",,"Springer Netherlands",03038300,,,,"English","Soc.

Here we use two important non-timber forest product species (NTFP: Inga capitata. Desv. – Fabaceae and Euterpe oleracea Mart. – Arecaeae) to compare germination across a forest regrowth gradient in the northeast Brazilian Amazon. Experimental treatments were used to examine the effects of mid to large-bodied vertebrates and litter cover on seed fate (germination, removal and invertebrate infestation) in 15 lowland sites within small-holder properties. Regrowth stage was classified into three groups, with five sites each of: late second-regrowth forest, early second-regrowth forest and abandoned pasture. We conducted a paired split-plot experiment using experimental plots composed of a vertebrate exclosure versus an open treatment and subplots with and without litter. We used Generalized Linear Mixed-Effects Models (GLMMs) to compare additive and interaction effects of treatments across regrowth stages compared with 15 paired control sites. We found that the effects of regrowth stage and exclosure were species specific and these effects differed between responses (germination, removal and invertebrate infestation). Clearing litter generated a significant effect only for invertebrate infestation, which increased in the cleared plots. Our findings show that seed removal limits germination success for both species across forest regrowth stages, with invertebrate infestation also having important but secondary effects. Increased removal and unfavorable abiotic conditions make direct seeding unviable in pasture sites. We suggest that direct seeding is a viable alternative for the establishment of these widely available NTFP species in late and early regrowth forests. © 2017 The Authors","Amazon forest; Direct seeding; Forest regrowth; Forest restoration; Forest succession; Germination; Mammal; Seed disperser; Seed predator; Vertebrate",,"Norris, D.; School of Environmental Sciences, Brazil; email: darren.norris@unifap.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

Several studies indicate that sustainable fruit harvesting limits can be set very high (>80% fruit harvesting intensity). For species with clonal and sexual reproduction, understanding how fruit harvest affects clonal reproduction can shed light on the genetic risks and sustainability of NTFP harvest. We studied 18 populations of a gallery forest tree, Pentadesma butyracea (Clusiaceae), to test the impact of fruits harvest, climate and habitat size (gallery forest width) on the frequency of sexual or clonal recruitment in Benin, West Africa. We sampled populations in two ecological regions (Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean) and in each region, we selected sites with low, moderate and high fruit harvesting intensities. These populations were selected in gallery forests with varying width to sample the natural variation in P. butyracea habitat size. Heavily harvested populations produced significantly less seedlings but had the highest density and proportion of clonal offspring. Our study suggests that for plant species with dual reproductive strategy (via seeds and clonal), fruit harvesting and associated disturbances that come with it can lead to an increase in the proportion of clonal offspring. This raises the issue that excessive fruit harvest by increasing the proportion of clonal offspring to the detriment of seed originated offspring may lead to a reduction in genetic diversity with consequence on harvested species capability to withstand environmental stochasticity. © 2017 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation","clonal reproduction; fruit harvest; gallery forest; non-timber forest products; Pentadesma butyracea (Clusiaceae); sustainable harvest","clone; dicotyledon; ecological impact; forestry; fruit; fruit production; habitat structure; harvesting; nontimber forest product; reproductive strategy; seedling; sexual reproduction; sustainability; tropical environment; Benin [West Africa]; Guinea; Sudan; Clusiaceae; Pentadesma butyracea","Gaoue, O.G.; Department of Botany, 3190 Maile Way, St John 101, United States; email: ogaoue@utk.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00063606,,BTROA,,"English","Biotropica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040670857

In ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the combination of different methods led to the development of a weak-coupling description of the early-time dynamics. The numerical observation of a classical universal attractor played a crucial role for this. Such attractors, also known as non-thermal fixed points (NTFPs), have been now predicted for different scalar and gauge theories. An important universal NTFP emerges in scalar theories modeling ultra-cold atoms, inflation or dark matter, and its scaling properties have been recently observed in an ultra-cold atom experiment. In this proceeding, recent progress in selected topics of the far-from-equilibrium evolution in these systems will be discussed. A new method to extract the spectral function numerically is a particularly promising tool to better understand their microscopic properties. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Hadrons; Heavy ions; Equilibrium dynamics; Microscopic properties; Physical systems; Scaling properties; Spectral function; Ultracold atoms; Ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision; Universal attractors; Dynamics","Boguslavski, K.; Department of Physics, P.O.

The kemenyan resin samples, which originated from North Tapanuli, Pakpak Bharat, and Humbang Hasundutan, showed high antioxidant activity with IC50 < 16 mg/L. The antioxidant activity of common kemenyan resin constituents, i.e., cinnamic acid, ethyl cinnamate, gallic acid, and vanillin was also investigated as positive control, although they exhibited lower antioxidant activity (IC50 < 1000 mg/L), except for gallic acid (IC50 = 5,23 mg/L). The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) for all samples were 44-66 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g sample and 143-160 mg quarcetin equivalents (QE)/g sample.

In order to achieve the mentioned goals, questionnaires were applied in case of Istanbul and 129 villagers participated in the questionnaire survey. The data were analysed by descriptive statistics and comparative analysis. The results obtained are: there are some problems on relations between forest and villagers and also NWFPs do not have direct effect on rural economic livelihood, however, the products contribute rural food supply. Thus, legal instruments, regulatory instruments, economical instruments (taxes and incentives), information-based instruments (education–research), and public relations and participation should be strengthened to increase the contribution of NWFPs to rural development. © 2018, Scibulcom Ltd.

Studies have shown that the most commonly studied exercise protocol for frail older adults is the multimodal training. Interactive video games (IVGs) involve tasks in virtual environments that combine physical and cognitive demands in an attractive and challenging way. The aim of this study will be to evaluate the feasibility, safety, acceptability, and functional outcomes of playing Nintendo Wii Fit PlusTM (NWFP) for frail older adults. Methods/design: The study is a randomized controlled, parallel group, feasibility trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to the experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). The EG will participate in 14 training sessions, each lasting 50 min, twice a week. In each training session, the participants will play five games, with three attempts at each game. The first attempt will be performed with the assistance of a physical therapist to correct the movements and posture of the patients and subsequent attempts will be performed independently. Scores achieved in the games will be recorded. The participants will be evaluated by a blinded physical therapist at three moments: before and after intervention and 30 days after the end of the intervention (follow-up). We will assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and clinical outcomes (postural control, gait, cognition, quality of life, mood, and fear of falling). Discussion: Due to the deficiencies in multiple systems, studies have shown that multimodal interventions including motor-cognitive stimulation can improve the mobility of frail elderly adults.

In our study, we used the primary datasets generated from the NWFP (https://nwfp.rothamsted.ac.uk/) to validate the SPACSYS model in terms of the dynamics of water loss and forage dry matter yield estimated through cutting. The SPACSYS model is capable of simulating soil water, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance in the soil-plant-atmosphere system. The validated model was then used to simulate the responses of soil water, C and N to reseeding grass cultivars with either high sugar (Lolium perenne L. cv. AberMagic) or deep rooting (Festulolium cv. Prior) traits. Simulation results demonstrated that the SPACSYS model could predict reliably soil water, C and N cycling in reseeded grassland. Compared to AberMagic, the Prior grass could fix more C in the second year following reseeding, whereas less C was lost through soil respiration in the first transition year. In comparison to the grass cultivar of the permanent pasture that existed before reseeding, both grasses reduced N losses through runoff and contributed to reducing water loss, especially Prior in relation to the latter. The SPACSYS model could predict these differences as supported by the rich dataset from the NWFP, providing a tool for future predictions on less characterized pasture. © 2017 The Authors","North Wyke Farm Platform; Nutrient cycling; Reseeding; Soil water; SPACSYS","Agriculture; Forecasting; Nitrogen; Soil moisture; North Wyke Farm Platform; Nutrient cycling; Reseeding; Soil water; SPACSYS; Soils; carbon; nitrogen; sugar; water; assessment method; grassland; nitrogen cycle; nutrient cycling; soil carbon; soil respiration; soil water; Article; biomass; carbon cycling; cultivar; grassland; nitrogen cycling; perennial ryegrass; priority journal; runoff; simulation; soil; soil respiration; Festulolium; Lolium perenne; Poaceae","Wu, L.; Sustainable Soils and Grassland Systems Department, North Wyke, United Kingdom; email: lianhai.wu@rothamsted.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"28614739","English","Sci.

The supply of such products has been commonly evaluated at the local (plot) scale; however, little is known about how their availability and diversity change at the landscape scale, particularly in heterogeneous environments. This information is critical in designing landscape forest management programs. Here, we assess the extent to which the frequency, abundance, diversity, composition and productivity (aboveground biomass) of tree assemblages with potential forest products (PFPs) change across three landscape units (LUs) that differ in soil and topographic conditions. The study was carried out in a well-conserved old-growth tropical rainforest in southeastern Mexico. Three plots (0.5 ha each) were established per LU, in which all trees ≥ 10 cm were inventoried, taxonomically identified and assigned to eight forest product categories. General linear models, multiple regression and ordination analysis (CCA) were used to assess structural and compositional changes in the tree assemblages supplying different PFPs among LUs and along soil physicochemical gradients. More than half (94 species, 57%) of the total number of identified species (165) had one or more PFPs, mostly related to timber products. Ordination analysis showed that the abundance of species with different PFPs has a heterogeneous distribution among LUs, mostly related to changes in soil nitrogen, pH and aluminum saturation. Variation among LUs in terms of tree biomass was strongly driven by soil available phosphorus and soil physiological depth. Each LU had a different potential to provide forest products, producing a diverse mosaic of PFPs within the landscape. Decisions concerning sustainable forest management should consider such variability in the availability and diversity of forest products across landscapes, as well as the environmental factors that govern this spatial variation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Extractivism potential; Geopedological land units; Lacandon tropical rainforest; Soil properties; Species turnover","Soils; Timber; Tropics; Extractivism potential; Geopedological land units; Soil property; Species turnover; Tropical rain forest; Forestry; abundance; biomass; environmental factor; forest management; forest product; landscape ecology; Neotropical Region; old-growth forest; pedology; physicochemical property; rainforest; soil property; spatial variation; species diversity; sustainability; taxonomy; turnover; Forest Products; Land Use; Nitrogen; Tropical Atmospheres; Mexico [North America]","Martínez-Ramos, M.; Instituto de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas y Sustentabilidad, Antigua carretera a Pátzcuaro No. 8701, Col.

We evaluate whether the degree of forest dependency influences ethnobotanical knowledge by comparing two indigenous communities in Suriname. Traditional knowledge was documented and vouchers collected during forest walks with adult informants. Questionnaires were completed by 74 schoolchildren (age 4 to 14) to capture their knowledge of names and uses of nine important NTFPs. We tested for knowledge differences by ethnicity and NTFP categories. Local names for NTFPs were analyzed to determine cross-cultural transmission of ethnobotanical knowledge. Children from the forest-dependent Trio community (n = 23) possessed similar knowledge of NTFPs as their more urbanized peers from Apoera (n = 51). NTFP uses were acquired at an earlier age than plant names. Food and commercial NTFP uses were better known than medicinal plant uses. Cross-cultural transfer of knowledge occurred between the two communities. NTFP knowledge of children appeared to be influenced more by the time they spent within the forest, either walking to school or walking to agricultural plots, than by the level of forest dependency or acculturation. © 2017, The Author(s).","indigenous peoples; knowledge transmission; non-timber forest products; Suriname; Traditional ethnobotanical knowledge",,"van den Boog, T.; Forest Resources Management, Canada; email: timvdboog@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

The aim of this study was to elucidate vegetation patterns of a secondary hillside rainforest remnant (elevation 120–330 m, 76 ha) as an outcome of natural processes, and anthropogenic processes linked to changing forest values. Methods: In the rainforest remnant tree species and various bio-physical parameters (relating to soils and terrain) were surveyed on forty 20 m × 20 m sized plots. The forest's vegetation patterns and tree diversity were analysed using dendrograms, canonical correspondence analysis, and other statistical tools. Results: Forest tree species richness was high (172 in the survey, 94 per hectare), including many endemic species (>16%; some recently described). Vegetation patterns and diversity were largely explained by topography, with colline/sub-montane species present mainly along hillside ridges, and lowland/humid-tropical species predominant on lower slopes. Scarcity of high-value timber species reflected past logging, whereas abundance of light-demanding species, and species valued for fruits, provided evidence of human-aided forest restoration and ‘enrichment’ in terms of useful trees. Exhaustion of sought-after forest products, and decreasing appreciation of non-wood products concurred with further encroachment of exotic plantations in between 2010 and 2015. Regeneration of rare tree species was reduced probably due to forest isolation. Conclusions: Despite long-term anthropogenic influences, remnant forests in the lowlands of Vietnam can harbor high plant biodiversity, including many endangered species. Various successive future changes (vanishing species, generalist dominance, and associated forest structural-qualitative changes) are, however, expected to occur in small forest fragments. Lowland forest biodiversity can only be maintained if forest fragments maintain a certain size and/or are connected via corridors to larger forest networks. Preservation of the forests may be fostered using new economic incentive schemes. © 2017, The Author(s).","Biodiversity conservation; Floristic patterns; NTFP; Secondary evergreen monsoon forest; Timber; Tree species richness",,"Cochard, R.; Institute of Integrative Biology, Universitätsstrasse 16, Switzerland; email: r_cochard@bluemail.ch",,"SpringerOpen",20956355,,,,"English","For.

This has been prompted by the fact that communities living adjacent to forest reserves rely to a great extent on the NTFPs for their livelihoods, and therefore any effort to conserve such resources should as a prerequisite understand how the host communities interact with them. Methods: Multistage sampling technique was used for the study. A representative sample of 400 households was used to explore the utilization of NTFPs and their contribution to households’ income in communities proximate to Falgore Game Reserve (FGR) in Kano State, Nigeria. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze and summarize the data collected. Results: The findings reveal that communities proximate to FGR mostly rely on the reserve for firewood, medicinal herbs, fodder, and fruit nuts for household use and sales. Income from NTFPs accounts for 20–60% of the total income of most (68%) of the sampled households. The utilization of NTFPs was significantly influenced by age, sex, household size, main occupation, distance to forest and market. Conclusions: The findings suggest that NTFPs play an important role in supporting livelihoods, and therefore provide an important safety net for households throughout the year particularly during periods of hardship occasioned by drought. It is suggested that stakeholders should prioritize technical and financial support programs on agricultural value addition and handcrafts that would promote off-farm income generating activities, in addition, provision of alternative domestic cooking energy such as biogas in communities proximate to FGR in order to reduce pressure relating to fuelwood gathering from the forest, this will help to improve forest resources quality. © 2017, The Author(s).","Agricultural income; Collection; Conservation; Forest income; Game Reserve","Agriculture; Conservation; Refuse collection; Regression analysis; Timber; Agricultural income; Descriptive statistics; Forest income; Game Reserve; Income generating activities; Logistic regression analysis; Non-timber forest products; Representative sample; Forestry; forest resource; household income; livelihood; nature conservation; nontimber forest product; rural economy; Kano [Nigeria]; Nigeria","Suleiman, M.S.; Department of Land Resource Management and Agricultural Technology, P.O.

Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP)which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO2eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architecture; Boats; Building materials; Buildings; Construction industry; Employment; Forestry; Lakes; Offshore structures; Product design; Project management; Sea level; Tall buildings; Urban planning; Water levels; Wood; Wooden construction; Construction sectors; Constructive technique; Environmental benefits; Non-timber forest products; Schoenoplectus californicus; Traditional constructions; Traditional techniques; Wood-based materials; Construction",,"Marschalko M.Drusa M.Rybak J.Yilmaz I.Segalini A.Coisson E.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17578981,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Where available, existing estimates suggest the non-cash benefits of forests are substantial, in many cases three to ten times higher than those for which systematic national and global data are collected. Part of this under-valuation stems from a general focus by governments on forest resources that are commercially valued as well as from government failure to include estimates of NTFP contributions in their national accounts. Beyond these reasons, however, lay methodological challenges in measurement techniques and comparability across studies, countries, and regions, both of which result in limited data on NTFPs. This article reviews NTFP studies at the global and national levels to provide estimates of the non-cash contributions of NTFPs and to shed light on challenges related to the absence of systematic, reliable data on the economic contributions of forests. The article then considers the implications for forest governance, management, and policy, arguing that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer an opportunity to increase attention on the non-cash contributions of forests and turn this invisible contribution into a visible one. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Forest valuation; Forests; Non-cash value; NTFPs; NWFPs; SDGs","Resource valuation; Forest valuations; Forests; Non-cash value; NTFPs; NWFPs; SDGs; Forestry; Data Processing; Forest Products; Forests",,,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

However, the broader scale impacts of NTFP harvesting have been acknowledged but rarely examined. We assessed plant size and the soil attributes undercanopy and in the open, in replicate, paired harvested and non-harvested sites for three NTFPs differing in the extent of biomass removed, i.e. timber for firewood from a tree (Acacia karroo), fruits from a cactus (Opunita ficus-indica) and flowering culms from a grass (Cymbopogon marginatus). Soil variables tested included pH, resistivity, P, total N, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, K, Na, Ca and Mg. The extent of loss of soil nutrients decreased across the three NTFPs relative to the proportion of biomass removed. Thus, significant differences in more soil variables were evident for the firewood species, least for the fruit species and intermediate for the grass species. Lower soil pH, P, C and K were evident in soils collected underneath A. karroo, while losses in cations of Na, Ca and Mg were reported in soils underneath C. marginatus, and only NO3N losses were recorded underneath O. ficus-indica. Synthesis and applications. Our study reveals that while non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting may affect soil nutrients, this is not uniform between species and is likely to be a function of the extent of biomass removed and harvesting frequency. This indicates the need for caution in generalisations about the ecosystem-level impacts of NTFP harvesting as well as a concerted effort to better understand impacts at a greater range of scales than has been the case to date. © 2017 The Authors.

Due to increased demand for rattan products, rattans have been extracted indiscriminately from the Western Ghats, a 1600-km mountain chain running parallel to the west coast of India. Extensive harvesting, loss of habitat and poor regeneration has resulted in dwindling rattan populations, necessitating an urgent attempt to conserve existing rattan resources. In this study, using niche-modelling tools, an attempt has been made to identify areas of high species richness of rattans in the Western Ghats, one of the mega-diversity regions of the world. We have also developed conservation values for 21 economically important and endemic rattans of the Western Ghats. We identified at least two to three sites of extremely high species richness outside the existing protected area network that should be prioritized for in situ conservation. This study emphasizes the need to develop strategies for the long-term conservation of rattans in the Western Ghats, India. © 2017 Kunming Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences","Calamus; Distribution; Gap analysis; NTFP; Protected areas; Species distribution models",,"Aravind, N.A.; Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Srirampura, Jakkur PO, India; email: aravind@atree.org",,"KeAi Publishing Communications Ltd.",20962703,,,,"English","Plant Diversity",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051023551

Goat meat preference is the main reason for its increased demand. In the country, there are 25 goat breeds and two wild relatives such as Mark and Goats. At present, Pakistan has 53.8 million goats, according to the 2006 GOP report, and their population growth rate was more than 3% per year (37, 23, 22, and 18% of the goat population in Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and NWFP, respectively). Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is considered to be one of the major constraints on increasing the productivity of goats and sheep in the areas where they exist and become local. It is closely related to cattle and buffalo rinderpest virus, dogs and other wild predator distemper virus, human measles virus, and marine mammalian measles virus. The present study aimed to determine the screening of the PPRV, Capra Hircus Lin. population, in the Khairpur Mirs District, Sindh, Pakistan. We selected 290 goats for serum sample collection and analysis using competitive ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Our results showed that 59 (64%) of the 92 clinical cases were positive and 33 (36%) were seronegative. The study concluded that PPR might be more prevalent in the Khairpur District. Furthermore, it is highly recommended to use homologous PPR-attenuated vaccines to prevent lethal virus attacks that control PPR in the country. © 2017 The Authors.","Capra hircus lin; Khairpur population; Peste des petits ruminants virus; PPRV screening","Article; blood sampling; controlled study; domestic goat; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; geographic distribution; male; nonhuman; Pakistan; peste des petits ruminants; Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus; screening test; seroprevalence","Ujan, J.A.; Department of Zoology, Pakistan; email: javedujjan@yahoo.com",,"Fundacao de Pesquisas Cientificas de Ribeirao Preto",16765680,,,,"English","Genet.

The aim of this paper is to review the literature on the relationship between phytosanitary problems and trade development. Production and trade of pine nuts in Mediterranean Europe have been negatively affected by the spreading of Diplodia sapinea (a fungus) associated with an adventive insect Leptoglossus occidentalis (fungal vector), with impacts on forest management, production and profitability and thus in value chain organization. Reduced availability of domestic production in markets with a growing demand has stimulated the import of pine nuts. China has become a leading exporter of pine nuts, but its export is affected by a symptom caused by the nuts of some pine species: 'pine nut syndrome' (PNS). Most of the studies mentioned in the literature review concern PNS occurrence associated with the nuts of Pinus armandii. We highlight the need for a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to the analysis of the pine nuts value chain organization, where research on food properties and clinical toxicology may be connected to breeding and forest management, forest pathology and entomology, and trade development. © 2017 by the authors.","Cacogeusia; Diplodia sapinea (Sphaeropsis blight); Leptoglossus occidentalis (Western conifer seed bug); Non-wood forest products; Pine mouth syndrome (PMS); Pine nut; Pine nut syndrome (PNS)","Chains; Commerce; Medicine; Research and development management; Cacogeusia; Conifer seeds; Diplodia sapinea (Sphaeropsis blight); Non-wood forest products; Pine mouth syndrome (PMS); Pine nut; Pine nut syndrome (PNS); Forestry; disease vector; entomology; forest management; forest product; forestry production; fungus; insect; literature review; market development; nut; pathology; profitability; toxicology; trade; Forest Management; Forest Products; Pathology; Pinus Armandii; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Diplodia; Fungi; Hexapoda; Leptoglossus occidentalis; Pinus armandii; Sphaeropsis","Pettenella, D.; Department Land, Italy; email: davide.pettenella@unipd.it",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030096522

However, there is a limited indication of the proportion of all households trading one or more NTFPs, and how it varies in relation to local context. Therefore, this study sought to establish the proportion of households trading in NTFPs in sites of different distances to urban markets and agro-ecological zones of South Africa. The results showed that about 6.4% households reported selling NTFPs for various reasons, with many (22%) citing the need to earn cash income and limited employment opportunities (16.9%). Even though the returns from trading NTFPs are relatively low, every earning is very important to many cash-strapped rural households. This was demonstrated by the fact that many sellers of NTFPs used their earnings to augment household income and cover their living expenses.","agro-ecological potential; distance to market; household income; livelihoods; NTFP trade","employment; household income; livelihood; nontimber forest product; rural economy; South Africa",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Here, we assess the impact of forest protection on a novel measure of wellbeing that incorporates both objective and subjective components of people's lives. In five villages near forests with mixed protection status in Tanzania, household perceived need for firewood is compared with actual consumption in order to provide a simple metric of firewood sufficiency. Firewood sufficiency varied with forest protection status, with non-compliance inferred by household ability to meet firewood needs despite forest access restrictions. Fuel-efficient stove ownership improved the perceived ability to meet firewood needs; however, actual consumption remained unchanged. Firewood sufficiency was significantly lower for those sourcing firewood outside forests, and increased household awareness of the management authority significantly reduced firewood consumption. In a forest landscape of mixed protection status, pressure will likely be displaced to the forest with the least active management authority, affecting their efficiency as non-extractive reserves. Our findings reinforce the need for a landscape approach to forest management planning that accounts for local needs, to avoid leakage to other less well-protected forests and detriment to household welfare. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2017.","Landscape approach; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Participatory forest management (PFM); Payments for ecosystem services (PES); REDD+; Wellbeing","Ecosystems; Timber; landscape approach; Non-timber forest products; participatory forest management (PFM); Payments for ecosystem services (PES); REDD; Wellbeing; Forestry; ecosystem service; forest management; landscape planning; management practice; nontimber forest product; ownership; participatory approach; rural area; wood; Tanzania","Latham, J.E.; CIRCLE, United Kingdom; email: julialatham@gmail.com",,"Cambridge University Press",03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

(1) Background: The two-fold aim was to develop solutions to the impacts of resettlement on natural and social capital, and strategies for timely intervention and new livelihoods after households were resettled. (2) Methods: Livelihood survey of all 46 households was conducted in 2010, and villagers were asked about 2004, before resettlement, and about 2009, when the occupants of Bo Hon village had been moved to a new location 15 km away from the original one. The research employed mixed-methods by using household surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. The impacts of displacement and resettlement on production activities and daily life of rural people were examined in the following areas: (i) land resource; (ii) access to common-pool natural resources; (iii) income structure; (iv) agriculturally based livelihoods; (v) material assets; (vi) customary practices; and (vii) social relationships. (3) Results: The most significant impact was on the type of production activities that could be conducted after resettlement and reduction in land area to grow profitable commodities such as Lồ Ô Bamboo. Specifically, land for growing rice and other crops were significantly affected with the land area substantially reduced or flooded. Also harvesting of common pool resources from the forest (NTFPs) were reduced such as honey and rattan, and only 25% of the villagers continued to fish in the river. (4) Conclusions: Strategies were put in place to reduce the level of disruption to the villagers' livelihoods, but some parts of the compensation package were short-lived or inequitably distributed (e.g., land), while infrastructure developments such as sealed roads have made the village far more accessible to Hue City some 25 km away. © 2017 by the authors.

Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) seed harvesting from natural forests is one of the cornerstone NTFP economies in Amazonia. In the Peruvian Amazon it is organized in a concession system. Drawing on seed production estimates of >135,000 individual Brazil nut trees from >400 concessions and ethno-ecological interviews with >80 concession holders, here we aimed to (i) assess the accuracy of seed production estimates by Brazil nut seed harvesters, and (ii) validate their traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) about the variables that influence Brazil nut production. We compared productivity estimates with actual field measurements carried out in the study area and found a positive correlation between them. Furthermore, we compared the relationships between seed production and a number of phenotypic, phytosanitary and environmental variables described in literature with those obtained for the seed production estimates and found high consistency between them, justifying the use of the dataset for validating TEK and innovative hypothesis testing. As expected, nearly all TEK on Brazil nut productivity was corroborated by our data. This is reassuring as Brazil nut concession holders, and NTFP harvesters at large, rely on their knowledge to guide the management of the trees upon which their extractive economies are based. Our findings suggest that productivity estimates of Brazil nut trees and possibly other NTFP-producing species could replace or complement actual measurements, which are very expensive and labour intensive, at least in areas where harvesters have a tradition of collecting NTFPs from the same trees over multiple years or decades. Productivity estimates might even be sourced from harvesters through registers on an annual basis, thus allowing a more cost-efficient and robust monitoring of productivity levels. © 2017 Thomas et al.

Many of those businesses have demonstrated innovation in the sphere of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), although these products had been neglected in the past, and their potentials are still underestimated. Therefore, our aim was to get a better understanding of the innovation processes behind three case studies in selected SEE countries (Slovenia, Serbia and FYR Macedonia). For the purpose of this research, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with people responsible for the selected innovation cases in three NTFP-based enterprises. The interviews revolved around questions related to the idea and product development, the firm foundation, the supporting and hindering factors and the actors and their roles in the entire process of business development. To understand the framework conditions, we interviewed representatives of the organizations that were in charge of supporting innovation and business development. The results show that several national policy programs (e.g., in the fields of SMEs, forestry and nature protection) form a framework for supporting NTFPs innovation. However, in all the selected countries, there were no policies specifically tailored for NTFPs.

Harvest often takes place in human disturbed ecosystems. However, our understanding of NTFPs harvesting impacts in fragmented habitats is limited. We assessed the impacts of fruit harvest, and reduction in habitat size on the population structures of Pentadesma butyracea Sabine (Clusiaceae) across two contrasting ecological regions (dry vs. moist) in Benin. In each region, we selected three populations for each of the three fruit harvesting intensities (low, medium and high). Harvesting intensities were estimated as the proportion of fruits harvested per population. Pentadesma butyracea is found in gallery forests along rivers and streams. We used the width of gallery forests as a measure of habitat size. We found negative effects of fruit harvest on seedling and adult density but no significant effect on population size class distribution in both ecological regions. The lack of significant effect of fruit harvest on population structure may be explained by the ability of P. butyracea to compensate for the negative effect of fruit harvesting by increasing clonal reproduction. Our results suggest that using tree density and population structure to assess the ecological impacts of harvesting clonal plants should be done with caution. © 2017 Gaoue et al.

Anticipated impacts on future access to medicines, nutritious foods, particularly indigenous fruits, and sustainable biofuels, demands that action is taken to protect and conserve such valuable, neglected and underutilized species (NUS), especially in the tropics where the use of non-timber forest products (NTFP) is considerable. Primarily, the protection of such plant genetic resources is achieved through the complementary approaches of in situ and ex situ conservation; for the latter, generally as dry seeds stored at -20°C. However, tropical forest species - which are estimated to constitute about 50% of the world’s plants - tend not to be so readily amenable to such an approach, and attention is now focusing increasingly on cryopreservation. This review considers the following issues: how plant cryopreservation studies have evolved over time and the extent of application of cryobiotechnology (scale); the policy current drivers and biodiversity needs that provide a framework for current and future plant cryopreservation studies (scope); and which technological innovations, knowledge and understanding might fast-track the science and accelerate the mainstreaming of plant cryopreservation particularly for tropical seeds (hope). Whilst significant progress in plant/seed cryobiotechnology has been made in the last decades, a co-ordinated global research and training programme aimed at accelerating the cryobanking of tropical plants of value to humankind is now urgently needed. © 2017, International Society for Horticultural Science.

Communities experience both costs and benefits associated with nearby PAs, and perception of these influence support for PAs and subsequent conservation related behaviors. This paper explores the concerns and benefits of 10 adjacent communities surrounding Mole National Park in Ghana using key informants, focus groups and household surveys. Overall, most people have a positive attitude towards the park. Yet, in many communities respondents also have negative attitudes. Crop depredation, loss of farmlands, and lack of access to NTFPs are the top three concerns. Increased conservation awareness, provision of ecosystem services and maintenance of cultural identity are the top three benefits. This study examined a number of factors thought to influence attitudes to PAs, and found that the strongest predictor of a community’s attitude towards the park is whether it is involved in a community resource management area (CREMA). Other factors such as distance from the PA, involvement in tourism, culture, and demographics (age and gender) were also significant but of less importance. Knowledge of these influential factors can assist management to create more favourable perceptions of protected areas. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adjacent communities; benefits of PAs; concerns of PAs; national parks; Protected areas","attitudinal survey; conservation management; cost-benefit analysis; cultural identity; ecosystem service; household survey; local participation; national park; park management; perception; protected area; public attitude; Ghana; Mole National Park; Northern Region [Ghana]","Rollins, R.; Department of Tourism and Recreation Management, Canada; email: rick.rollins@viu.ca",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",13504509,,IJSDB,,"English","Int.

We modeled population growth and fiber production in the next 20 years under different management scenarios using Integral Projection Models. Although there was a low proportion of seedlings and population structure was variable, the population would grow for the next 20 years, with an annual growth rate of 7.1%, yielding ca. 35 spear leaves/ha/year for artisanal activity. Simulations of the model show that the population is susceptible to alterations that affect the survival of individuals; removal of as few as 34 palms of any size per ha/year would cause the population to decrease, and spear leaf production will decline accordingly. Conversely, any increase in seedling growth or survival would lead to population growth.

However, deforestation and illegal as well as legal logging pose a threat to resin yielding species (Dipterocarpus spp.). There is still more to be learned about resin yield, harvest techniques, and the importance of resin to local livelihoods. This study quantifies yields from one of the most intensively tapped resin species, Dipterocarpus alatus, and estimates household incomes from resin extraction in Cambodia. A total of 43 resin tappers were interviewed and 100 resin trees were measured to examine factors affecting resin productivity. Forest-adjacent households were highly dependent on resin extraction for cash income. Households spent an average of 105 days annually on resin extraction. The mean annual household gross-income derived from liquid resin was USD 3,236. Solid resin contributed only a small part of household incomes except for the most remote and isolated village, Spong, in which solid resin contributed significantly to the gross-income. Resin trees yielded an average of 18 liters of oleoresin per year according to interview findings, and yield was positively correlated with the size and health of the tree, and with proximity to watercourses. Finally, yield was influenced by season and condition of the tapping-hole. © 2018 Siam Society.

Diminishing agarwood trees in natural forest due to intensive harvesting has shifted the production paradigm to forest plantation. In order to support agarwood tree improvement, investigation on the agarwood tree genomes and genes involved in agarwood production is highly needed through genomic library construction. This research aimed at establishing cloning protocols for genomic library construction of agarwood tree (Aquilaria malaccensis) until sequencing process. Genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit from Qiagen, then was digested with EcoR1, and was ligated to pGem®-T Easy vector system before it was finally transformed and was cloned to E.coli strain DH5α. Confirmation of DNA inserts was done using PCR colony with universal primer of SP6 and T7, plasmid isolation and also PCR plasmid and plasmid DNA digestion used Quick Plasmid Miniprep Kit from Thermofisher. Cloned A. malaccensis DNA fragments were sequenced and BLAST at NCBI site. The cloning successfully obtained five white colonies which contain inserted A. malaccensis DNA fragments with the size of 136-225 bp. PCR colony, plasmid isolation, PCR plasmid, and plasmid DNA digestion had confirmed the existence of inserted A. malaccensis DNA genome inside the bacteria cells. Sequencing and BLAST showed that DNA inserts from colony number 6, 8, and 9 were not similar with A. malccensis sequence that was recorded in NCBI, indicating that the genomic region in this library construction is different from the genomic DNA sequences of A. malaccensis in NCBI. © 2017, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

We focus on two well-studied large WF regions, one in western Texas and the other in northern Illinois. These two regions differ distinctively in terms of land cover, topography, and background climate, allowing us to examine whether the WF impacts on vegetation, if any, vary due to the differences in atmospheric and boundary conditions. We use three methods (spatial coupling analysis, time series analysis, and seasonal cycle analysis) and consider two groups of pixels, wind farm pixels (WFPs) and non-wind-farm pixels (NWFPs), to quantify and attribute such impacts during the pre- and post-turbine periods. Our results indicate that the WFs have insignificant or no detectible impacts on local vegetation growth. At the pixel level, the VI changes demonstrate a random nature and have no spatial coupling with the WF layout. At the regional level, there is no systematic shift in vegetation greenness between the pre- and post-turbine periods. At interannual and seasonal time scales, there are no confident vegetation changes over WFPs relative to NWFPs. These results remain robust when the pre- and post-turbine periods and NWFPs are defined differently. Most importantly, the majority of the VI changes are within the MODIS data uncertainty, suggesting that the WF impacts on vegetation, if any, cannot be separated confidently from the data uncertainty and noise. Overall, there are some small decreases in vegetation greenness over WF regions, but no convincing observational evidence is found for the impacts of operating WFs on vegetation growth. © 2017 by the authors.","EVI; NDVI; Vegetation greenness; Wind farm","Electric utilities; Image reconstruction; Pixels; Radiometers; Time series analysis; Turbines; Wind power; Enhanced vegetation index; Moderate resolution; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Vegetation change; Vegetation greenness; Vegetation growth; Wind farm; Vegetation","Xia, G.; Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, United States; email: gxia@albany.edu",,"MDPI AG",20724292,,,,"English","Remote Sens.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022346834

We assessed local knowledge on the uses, habitat, and population status of Mimusops andongensis and Mimusops kummel, both multipurpose NTFP species in Benin, to promote their valorization and conservation and thus sustain local knowledge on their uses for domestication issues. One hundred households were randomly selected for structured interviews for M. andongensis and 500 for M. kummel. The relationship between age, sex, and ethnic groups and the species uses was assessed using comparison and correspondence analyses. Nearly all organs of the species were used. Both species were mainly exploited for medicinal purposes but also in construction and as firewood. We found similarities in some uses of the species organs, although the species occur in different ecological zones and are used by different ethnic groups. This result should be considered for the valorization of the species. Most informants reported that populations of M. andongensis were decreasing, although some felt that they were increasing, whereas less than one-third said that M. kummel was decreasing. There were strong relationships between gender, age, and ethnic affiliation of the users and the exploited organs of both species.

However, distinguishing non-timber forest products (NTFPs) harvesting impacts from timber extraction consequences on the vegetation could be difficult, since tropical forest species often have a multipurpose status. This study explores the purposes and characteristics of timber and non-timber products usage in the Swamp Forest of Lokoli (in the south of Benin Republic) and assesses extraction impacts on the forest dynamics. We used structural parameters analysis and ecological indices to explain the vegetation structure and the species responses to anthropogenic pressures. The results suggest that the forest is being devastated by extraction activities of the local people including both timber collection and non-timber harvesting. Finally, this paper suggests that management policies balancing socio-economic and conservation priorities, through introduction of alternative economic activities, strengthening of the local agriculture and a participatory management plan are the best options for the long term preservation of this forest.","forest dynamics; Lokoli; NTFPs; sustainable extraction; Swamp Forest","forest dynamics; forest management; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainable development; swamp forest; timber; Benin [West Africa]",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

These products can play an important role in the livelihood of households located in the forest. The present study aims to determine the most important sources of forest dwellers’ incomes in the northern Zagros in terms of three income groups (lower, middle, and higher), to assess how changes in income are related to types of NTFPs harvested, and to investigate the most significant socio-economic factors determining absolute and relative household revenue from NTFPs. Income in higher- and middle-income groups come predominantly from border trade between Iran and Iraq, comprising 50 and 44 % of relative income, respectively. The main source of income for the lower-income group is remittance and government interest (such as cash subsidies), comprising 31 % of total household annual income. The relative income from NTFPs depends on the income group, varying between 10 and 21 %. Relative income from NTFPs (such as oak acorns, firewood, Gazoo, and Mazooj) for lower-income households is significantly higher than in middle- and higher-income households (p < 0.05). Feed used for grazing livestock in the forest is the most important type of NTFPs in this area, and its benefit in the higher-income group is significantly higher than that for groups with middle and lower income. A similar result is achieved for tree fodder. Relative income from the NTFPs is positively related to number of household members and negatively related to the average education of adult members of the household, the relative income from border trade, and the relative income from agriculture. Our results support our hypothesis that if there is access to other sources of income for forest dwellers, their dependence on forests would be reduced. © 2016, Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Border trade; Grazing; Income groups; NTFPs; Socio-economic factors","border region; household income; livelihood; nontimber forest product; socioeconomic conditions; timber trade; Iran; Zagros","Maleknia, R.; Faculty of Agriculture, Iran; email: maleknia.r@lu.ac.ir",,"Springer Netherlands",18737617,,,,"English","Small-scale For.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994234445

The present study investigated the medicinal uses of various parts of Moringa oleifera in southern Benin. An ethnobotanical survey was carried out across the four phyto-districts of southern Benin (Plateau, Coast, Ouémé and Pobè) with a sample of 439 informants (201 women and 238 men) belonging to Fon, Waci, Xwla, Sahouè, Djerma, Kotafon, Aïzo, Goun, Yoruba socio-cultural groups. The informants include traditional medicine practitioners, householder, housewives, old men and women, adults, and the young. Various parts of Moringa oleifera are used to obtain traditional medicines to cure diseases. The study revealed up to 46 complete recipes traditionally made to heal 34 common diseases. These include venereal diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, tropical diseases, inflammatory complaints, oto-rhino-laryngologocal complaints, skin infections, digestive diseases, infertility disorders, etc. The mode of administration as well as the dosage of each medicine were recorded. It was found that among the plant parts used for this purpose, the leaf was the most used, followed by the roots, bark, seeds and pods. The consensual value of use types was estimated to prove the relative efficiency of each medicine. Moreover, the seeds were also found to be used to carry out rites for blessings and attracting customers and a sexual partner. The study showed that M. oleifera plays an important role in traditional medicine in the rural areas of South Benin, hence this study constitutes sound arguments for its production at large scale in agroforestry systems in Benin. The information collected is useful and can nurture more in-depth research on the part of modern medicine for better use of this species.","Agroforestry; Non-tree forest products; Ouémé; Traditional medicines",,,"Palada M.C.Ebert A.W.","International Society for Horticultural Science",05677572,9789462611,,,"English","Acta Hortic.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019964872

It was first introduced during early 1980s in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly NWFP) and was locally called as ground mulberry. It remained unnoticed until commercial production came from sporadic plantations of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Owing to its unique, desirable taste and high profitability, it was introduced in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. 'Chandler', 'Corona', 'Douglas', 'Tufts', 'Gorella' and 'Toro' are the important cultivars of strawberry. The climate of South Punjab is not ideal for production of strawberry runners. However, sourcing of runners from the Swat region (80% success rate) each year has made its cultivation a success in this region. It is now commercially cultivated on raised beds with double rows on loamy soils along the riverine belts of Chenab. Mostly, fruits are marketed using wooden baskets with 8-9 kg net fruit weight fetching US$ 1-2 kg-1 in local market (from February to April in Multan district). Average yield ha-1 varies between 5-10 t. Over 95% fruit is domestically consumed as fresh with little processing and negligible exports. Postharvest losses are very high (&gt;40%) mainly due to nonselective harvesting, poor packaging and transportation and almost absence of cold chain. Lack of systematic R&amp;D, shortage of quality runners, prevalence of insect pest and diseases, occurrence of high postharvest losses and limited processing facilities are the main impediments of strawberry industry development. At present, in South Punjab, cultivation of strawberry has not been exploited for its full production potential. Therefore, with improved infrastructure, production practices and postharvest facilities its quality production can be increased for domestic as well as export markets. The present study will provide comprehensive information on strawberry industry, along with its future prospects in South Punjab.","Marketing; Production; Strawberry; Subtropics",,,"Desjardins Y.","International Society for Horticultural Science",05677572,9789462611528,,,"English","Acta Hortic.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019949416

Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are among the forest products that serve as livelihood resources in the face of climate stresses. However, little is known on the extent to which NTFPs enhance the adaptive capacity of households adjacent to forests in the context of climate stresses. Based on ﬁeldwork in Kilombero District, we investigated how households adjacent to forests use NTFPs as different forms of capital asset to support adaptation strategies for livelihood outcomes. Data were collected using socio-economic appraisal. Three NTFPs out of twelve–firewood, medicinal plants and thatch grasses–were identified as priorities because of their immediate importance for supporting households. Priority NTFPs contributed to human, financial and physical capital assets. They also contributed about 3% of the total household annual income. Income and expenditure of priority NTFPs was significantly influenced (p <.05) by age of respondent, household size, distance to resources, change in management regimes of forest and wooded grassland and household income. The households indicated they would use priority NTFPs to improve livelihoods outcomes. Findings in this study can inform policy and support decision makers to establish mechanisms in conservation rules and regulations to enable forest adjacent households to access the NTFPs. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive capacity; climate stresses; Kilombero District; livelihoods; priority NTFPs","adaptive management; climate change; household expenditure; household income; household survey; living resource; nontimber forest product; prioritization; socioeconomic status; Kilombero; Morogoro [Tanzania]; Tanzania","Balama, C.; Department of Wood Utilization, PO Box 3014, Chuo Kikuu, Tanzania; email: balamapc@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17565529,,,,"English","Clim.

This paper characterises the diversity of governance arrangements for accessing and marketing indigenous natural products in communal areas of Namibia. Applying concepts from environmental governance, two main types of governance arrangements for accessing NTFPs are distinguished, i.e. community-level self-organised governance and network governance between the state and local communities. Application of the theory of global value chain governance reveals three main types of governance arrangements for accessing NTFP markets. These are: (1) market value chains for coordinating access to informal domestic markets, (2) captive value chains and (3) quasi-hierarchical value chains for accessing global markets. The arrangements for accessing resources and markets are further integrated into three main modes of NTFP governance in Namibia, i.e. network governance with high degree of state involvement; network governance with low degree of state involvement and active involvement of local communities and civil society; and a community-based self-organised governance at local level with dominance of local authorities. Considering this differentiated governance approach, there is scope for the development of an integrated policy framework that recognises NTFPs based on the different governance arrangements. © 2016 The Author(s).

This research evaluates the potential economic and development prospects from NTFP development in the Park by examining: (1) type of NTFP and economic value from community agrofrestry land, (2) contribution of NTFPs on household income, (3) development prospects of NTFP-based agroforestry around Sibolangit Tourism Park. The research was conducted in two selected villages around Sibolangit Tourism Park: Sembahe Village and Batu Mbelin Village. The research took place over a period between June and August 2016. Research data was obtained from in-depth interviews and observations. A descriptive method was used to analyze and describe facts related to the research aims. The type of NTFPs cultivated by communities at the research sites include mangosteen, durian, garcinia, candlenut, lanzones, lansium, bitter bean, and areca nut (as their forestry component) and ginger, turmeric, chili, papaya, etlingera, and banana (as the agriculture component). Most NTFPs are cultivated as a comercial product. The economic value of NTFPs in Batu Mbelin Village has reached IDR. 547,275,000/year or contribute 80.07% of total family income. Meanwhile, the economic value of NTFPs in Sembahe Village has reached IDR 682,100,000/year, contributing to 78.75% of total household income.

We interviewed 166 victims of sloth bear attacks which occurred between 2004 and 2016 and found that most attacks occurred in forests (81%), with the greatest number of those (42%) occurring during the collection of Non-Timber Forest Produce (NTFP), 15% during the collection of fuelwood and 13% during grazing of livestock. The remainder took place at forest edges or in agricultural fields (19%), most occurring when person(s) were working in fields (7%), defecating (5%), or engaged in construction work (3%). Most victims were between the ages of 31 to 50 (57%) and most (54%) were members of the Gond tribe. The majority of attacks occurred in summer (40%) followed by monsoon (35%) and winter (25%). Forty-four percent of victims were rescued by people, while 43% of the time bears retreated by themselves. In 60% of attacks, a single bear was involved, whereas 25% involved adult females with dependent cubs and the remainder (15%) of the cases involved a pair of bears. We discuss the compensation program for attack victims as well as other governmental programs which can help reduce conflict.

Data, collected using forest cruising, participatory observations, interviews with indigenous and local persons and experts, identified wild pistachio resin, wild pistachio fruit, oak fruit and oak syrup (Shokeh manna) among the non-timber products in this basin with total potential harvestable NTFPs of 77.16, 771.602, 13248.68, and 1324.868 tons per year, respectively. The economic rent from NTFPs is 33 US$/ha/year and its total expected values with consideration of real interest rate when the exploiter invests the capital in the bank (6.4 %) and when money is borrowed from the bank to execute the incorporated projects (8.4 %) are $516/ha and $393/ha, respectively. Furthermore, families’ economic share from potential profit of NTFPs is annually $601 per household. In addition wild pistachio resin has the highest share of the total potential profit of NTFPs and its equal to 51 % of the total of potential profit of NTFPs. Therefore, it is suggested that decisions be made to increase the infrastructure and strengthen the local selling market to enhance the cash income from NTFPs. Forest participatory management practices are suggested to organize and improve traditional use of the forests. © 2016, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Economic rent; Household livelihood; Net present value (NPV); Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Zagros forests","cost-benefit analysis; deciduous tree; economic rent; forest ecosystem; forest management; fruit; household income; interest rate; livelihood; market conditions; nontimber forest product; timber harvesting; Iran; United States; Zagros; Pistacia vera","Moradi, S.; University of GuilanIran; email: moradi_4@pnu.ac.ir",,"Northeast Forestry University",1007662X,,,,"English","J.

Exploited species also face threats from habitat fragmentation, fire, and invasive species. We assessed the impact of human disturbances and invasive species on the population of a key multipurpose NTFP species, Mimusops andongensis, in Lama Forest reserve (Benin). The densities of adult trees and regenerative stems decreased with increasing degradation. Mimusops andongensis contributed less to total tree density with increasing human disturbance. There were significantly fewer M. andongensis recruits with increasing cover of invasive Chromolaena odorata. Smaller diameter individuals predominated in non-degraded and moderately degraded sites while in degraded sites, the structure showed a negative exponential trend with the density of small diameter individuals being less than two trees/ha. Larger individuals were also rare in degraded sites. The low density of both mature trees and seedlings in degraded sites may undermine the long-term viability of M. andongensis, despite existing protection against NTFP harvesting and other anthropogenic pressures.

In mountainous areas of the Greater Mekong Subregion, government programs, scholars, and private-sector interests have promoted both as strategies for rural economic development. NTFPs are also often championed as an incentive for rural communities to protect forests. However, little is known about how cash crops and NTFPs interact in the daily lives and economic decisions of rural people in this region, or how they may differentially encourage forest conservation practices and values. With a focus on mushrooms as an NTFP and maca, rubber, and tea as cash crops, we conducted household surveys and key informant interviews in 2 prefectures of Yunnan, China, and 1 province in northern Thailand. Based on the results of this research, we make 4 key arguments. First, although cash crops are generally perceived to diminish the importance of NTFPs such as mushrooms in rural livelihoods, the potential also exists for complementarity between these 2 livelihood strategies. Second, while some species of wild edible mushroom incentivize forest conservation, others may incentivize practices that have a negative impact on forest ecosystems. Third, even in households where NTFPs make little or no contribution to livelihoods, people are likely to value forests for supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services. Fourth, even households that rely primarily on cash crops may value NTFP collection as a leisure activity. The latter phenomenon is previously unreported in NTFP research, and we suggest that it also reflects a blind spot in ecosystem services research. Mushrooms and cash crops can coexist in mountain livelihoods; wild mushrooms are both economic and recreational resources in the Greater Mekong. © 2017 McLellan and Brown.

In Burkina Faso, many wild tree species provide various useful products, among them the local oil tree, Lophira lanceolata which occurs in the western part of the country. This study aimed at assessing the habitat diversity and population structure of L. lanceolata’s natural stands according to land cover types. Two sites were considered: Banfora, where the use value of fruits is unknown and Orodara, where fruits are exploited for oil production. A stratified and oriented sampling scheme based on the occurrence of L. lanceolata and land cover was applied using rectangular plots of 50 m × 20 m. Phytosociological and quantitative inventories were carried out to assess the woody species diversity of stands and L. lanceolata population structure, respectively. Species diversity indices, structural parameters were computed and analyses of variance, Chi square test were performed to compare sites according to land cover types. The results showed high woody species diversity associated with L. lanceolata stands (H = 3.2–3.6). The densities of L. lanceolata ranged between 94 and 280 trees per hectare, with significant differences between land cover types and sites. The population pattern showed a good regeneration potential and high resource availability. L. lanceolata was fairly resilient to human pressure and tended to recolonize disturbed lands. With a high potential for sustainable management, L. lanceolata is a promising NTFP species which can contribute to improve the local and national economy. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Land cover; Lophira lanceolata; Oil plant; Population structure; Regeneration potentials; Species occurrence","biofuel; developing world; forest inventory; herb; income distribution; land cover; population structure; regeneration; resource availability; sampling; species diversity; species occurrence; variance analysis; Burkina Faso","Ouédraogo, A.; Laboratoire de Biologie et Ecologie Végétales, 03 B.P. 7021, Burkina Faso; email: o_amade@yahoo.fr",,"Springer Netherlands",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

Their real value, however, is underestimated and interesting innovative examples of marketed NTFP exist. Our article thus asks: How do innovations happen in a situation where there is very limited institutional innovation support, and how could non-Timber innovations be fostered? This is studied in the regional case study of the Austrian province Styria in which the role of policies and actors in innovation processes is examined. We find that support for non-Timber products is given from several sectoral innovation systems, including forestry, agriculture and nature conservation. Their influence, however, is limited as in none of them NTFP are in their specific focus but only recognised on the side. Non-Timber innovations are typically generated from bottomup in small, regional and often cross-sectoral ""ad-hoc"" networks. Effective diffusion of innovations is only reached through institutional innovations such as the formation of producers' associations. The best model for fostering innovations in NTFP would be ""top-down support for bottom-up innovations"". The article documents two successful examples for this model where the institutional system was able to give substantial and systemic support to local creativity and capacities, namely the forest-oriented LEADER-Region ""Zirbenland"" and the Styrian Nature Parks Association.","Austria; Case study; Forestry; Innovation system; Non-Timber forest products (NTFP); Styria","bottom-up approach; forestry production; innovation; institutional reform; literature review; nontimber forest product; forestry; timber harvesting; timber industry; timber market; Austria; Styria","Weiss, G.; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences ViennaAustria; email: gerhard.weiss@boku.ac.at",,"Osterreichischer Agrarverlag GmbH",03795292,,,,"English","Austrian J.

Some of these small and very small towns have risen because of a resource base provided by their proximity to forests and access to this ecosystem which consists not only of timber, but also non-timber forest products (NTFP).

In contrast to dominant narratives focusing on regulations and customs, these chains are actually governed by dynamic, multiple arrangements regulating access to resources and markets. New institutions have been created, led by project-related civil society organisations and enterprises. These increasingly take on roles traditionally the reserve of governments. In some chains, the state performs its duties, in others not. Customary authorities, projects, non-government organisations and market institutions fill some voids. Often actors with little voice in formal governance create their own messy, bricolaged arrangements, and governance based on 'exclusiveness' produces some of the most sustainable chains and livelihoods in the long term.

The analysis of this process is the core of this research that examines the development opportunities of a sample of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) based on the sustainable use of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) in a specific area of Central Serbia. The research focuses in particular on the dynamics of purchasing and marketing on NWFPs, both in terms of quantities and market value. The subjects of the research are: purchased and sold quantities in analyzed companies, as well as the prices of these products in the market. The research included 55 companies engaged in purchasing, processing and sale of NWFPs. The response rate in the research was 87.3%. In this paper, the following NWFPs are considered: mushrooms, medicinal and aromatic plants and forest fruits. All interviews, which were conducted, contained qualitative and quantitative questions and a section of socio-economic questions. The data are divided into those related to the purchase of raw materials, the sale of final NWFPs on the domestic market, and to NWFPs export. The aim of the research (in terms of the analyzed companies) were: income / outcomes, processing facilities, supply, export destination, price (purchase and sale) and distribution channels. The primary use of parametric statistics through regression analysis was to determine the average annual growth rates (AAGR) (in the purchase, sale on the domestic market and exports). The most of the SMEs in NWFPs sector of Central Serbia are situated in rural areas (app. 67.4%) and 63.5% are small and micro enterprises. All of them are privately owned. Most of the SMEs in Central Serbia are engaged in mushrooms and forest fruits business (83.3%). SMEs in NWFPs were only working at 52.5% of capacity. Regarding the quantity of NWFPs that are processed and placed on the domestic and foreign markets in Serbia, fungi were the greatest product in the period examined (1993-2014). In Central Serbia export orientation of NWFPs is higher by 2.57 times, compared to sales on the domestic market.

In Mexico, the use of NTFP considered by the government to be “at risk” is regulated by “wildlife conservation management units” (UMAs), a policy instrument that seeks to reconcile biological conservation with local development. Its effectiveness varies according to the context in which the instrument is applied. The majority of UMAs in the south of the Mexico, particularly for NTFPs, have shown less than encouraging results, partly because their design and implementation do not take into account the complexity and diversity of the conditions present in rural areas in this part of the country. Based on ethnographic observation, in-depth interviews, and socioeconomic surveys, this article analyzes the implementation of a palm (palma camedor) UMA in two rural villages in the Lacandon rain forest in Chiapas, Mexico. We argue that these palm UMAs assume a simplified conception of the complex reality of these communities, in which the implementation of the management instrument alters the local balance of power. Its bureaucratic design and overregulating character generates discretionality, simulation, and corruption, which in turn accentuates exclusions and favors local elites. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,"Arango, G.B.; El Colegio de San Luis, Mexico; email: gabuar@hotmail.com",,"Latin American Studies Association",00238791,,,,"English; Spanish","Lat.

Thirteen predicators that were selected from the attributes of forest, user group and governance of the local forest SES were used to evaluate their influence on SES sustainability. Our results showed that sustainable forest SES was significantly associated with forest size, diversity of the NTFP that is extracted from the forest, networks among the forest users, rule making by external non-forest harvest organizations in dispute resolution, and benefits sharing. On the other hand, the distance of forest users’ settlements in the forest, rule making for forest protection and harvest quantity as well as sanctions by external non-forest harvest organizations were found to be significantly associated with unsustainable forest SESs. Our findings have important implications for the ongoing discourse on how to promote sustainable forest management at local level.

In the Sahel, climate change and desertification intensify this problem and the local population is lacking woodland resources for daily life. Therefore, there is a need for improved and long-term restoration of degraded ecosystems. The present article investigates an approach of sustainable forest restoration by Assisted Natural Regeneration (ANR) with fencing, a technique adopted by newTree, a Swiss NGO, since 2003 in the Central and Northern zones of Burkina Faso. The present article investigates the effects of ANR on vegetation restoration and on population's livelihood. Methods include vegetation inventories, literature review, analysis of newTree technical reports from 2003 to 2012, stakeholders' interviews and cost-benefit examination. Results show a striking development of vegetation within only nine years of protection. Inventories of trees inside and outside fences show that variety of tree species and number of trees is much higher inside the protected areas than outside fencing. Moreover the approach of newTree contributes to farmers' livelihood improvement by the valorization of non-wood forest products (NWFP) and sustainable agriculture. Costs for fencing are relatively high but on the other hand the approach is very effective by involving the population in a participatory way. The double objective - biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction - can be effectively achieved by the whole approach of newTree using ANR technique. ANR could be applied in areas where tree planting is made difficult by the poverty and the lack of water for the creation of nurseries.","Assisted natural regeneration; Burkina Faso; Fencing; Forest restoration; NewTree; Sahel",,"Belem, B.; Action Group for Tree Promotion and Valuation in the SahelBurkina Faso; email: belbass@hotmail.com",,"Agri-Overseas",07713312,,,,"English","Tropicultura",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021720807

The focus of this research is land use in the Kuranji River Basin with an emphasis on the socioeconomics of people and forest condition upstream and its impact on the capability to maintain its functions especially for irrigation and municipal water supply. From 1994 to 2002, land use in the Kuranji River Basin has been changing with an annual forest area reduction of as much as 0.9975%, while the agroforest (mix garden) only increased 0.1225%, shrubs increased 0.6688%, rice field decreased 1.4288%, agriculture field increased 0.3838%, settlement increase 0.99%, and others (water bodies, road, etc.) increased 0.3713%. The driving factors of land-use changes in the Kuranji River Basin can be classified as a combination of population pressure and socioeconomic factors; population pressure in this area is high with an annual growth rate of 2.41%. People upstream of the river basin earn their living mostly from the agricultural sector as farmers. Besides working in the agriculture sector, people upstream in the river basin usually visit the forest for collecting nontimber forest products (NTFPs) (. asam kandis, manau, bamboo, rattan). hunting and trapping animals, and a few of them logging timber, and they also have agroforest in a communal forest. People upstream claim to have communal forest and they convert forest into mix garden (agroforest), which promises more income security than monoculture tree planting in area that is claimed as communal forest. People upstream have high awareness of the importance of forest for environment and they maintain the existence of forest, and only doing farming activity in their communal forest as an agroforest. Land-use changes, especially reducing the area of forest cover, did not significantly affect the water availability in the Kuranji River Basin and it is still adequate to fulfill all the demand for irrigation and municipal water supply. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

It is often argued that forest conservation contributes to poverty alleviation through provisioning of NTFPs to the poor. However, implicit assumptions of the argument that NTFPs are more intensively utilized by poor who lack alternative subsistence options, and that NTFP supplies are limited by forest cover, have rarely been critically examined. This study investigated social and environmental factors affecting NTFP uses in rural areas of Borneo, using a land cover map and socio-economic dataset collected from 1596 households in 87 villages. The NTFPs examined were wild boars, sambar deer, wild fruits, firewood, wild vegetables, and wild mushrooms. To explain the variations in NTFP uses among households, four village and nine household characteristics were considered using generalized linear mixed models. We found that forest cover and collection pressure limit the use of some NTFPs, supporting the second assumption. On the other hand, the first assumption was supported only for firewood, and animals and wild fruits were more frequently used by wealthier households, contrary to this assumption. Other factors (education, age and sex of householder and agricultural activities) were also related to the use of one or more NTFPs. This study demonstrates the complexity of the process by which forest cover and other factors affect the ecosystem services people receive. Evaluation of ecosystem services is an important and urgent research subject today, but it is also necessary to pay attention to who receives the benefits, and who does not. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Ecosystem services; Land cover; Poverty alleviation; Questionnaire survey; Sarawak; Tropical forests","complexity; data set; deer; ecosystem service; environmental factor; fruit; land cover; mushroom; nontimber forest product; pig; poverty alleviation; questionnaire survey; rural area; socioeconomic conditions; tropical forest; vegetable; Borneo; East Malaysia; Malaysia; Sarawak; Animalia; Basidiomycota; Cervidae; Cervus unicolor; Sus scrofa","Sakai, S.; Center for Ecological Research, Otsu, Japan; email: shokosakai@ecology.kyoto-u.ac.jp",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

These problems lie in assigning nurses to teams/shifts such that the constraints regarding both the working regulations and nurses preferences are satisfied. Recent research indicates the dependence of nursing team performance on team social structure; however, so far, the social structure considerations have not been explicitly incorporated into the mathematical formulations of the nurse scheduling problem. The presented framework introduces models that quantitatively exploit such dependence. This paper explores instances of Nurse Team Formation Problem (NTFP) and Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) incorporating signed social structure with the measures based on such network structures as edges, full dyads, triplets, k-stars, balanced and unbalanced triangles, etc., in directed, signed networks. The paper presents the integer programming formulations for NTFP and NSP, and a problem-specific heuristic that performs variable-depth neighborhood search to tackle NTFP instances with signed social structures. Computational results for a real-world problem instance with 20 nurses are reported. The insights obtained from the presented framework and future research directions are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Discrete optimization; Nurse scheduling; Shift assignment; Signed social networks; Team formation","health worker; network analysis; optimization; social network; social structure","Nikolaev, A.G.; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, United States; email: anikolae@buffalo.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",00380121,,,,"English","Socio-Econ.

In the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) program in Burkina Faso, women are targeted in projects promoting non-timber forest product commercialisation aimed to incentivise forest conservation. Such policies are often based on essentialist assumptions about what men and women do, ignoring that social relations of inequality need to be understood in context. Drawing on intersectional theory this study analyses REDD+ documents, and data about resource use in two villages in Burkina Faso, showing how the participatory approach in Burkina's REDD+ program is unlikely to encourage currently marginalised voices to be heard in existing forest management organisations. Rather, the lack of acknowledgement of intersecting relations of inequality leads to crucial aspects of NTFP resource use being overlooked, and risks leading to increased marginalisation of certain groups.","climate policy; environmental governance; Gender; intersectionality; NTFP","conservation; deforestation; emission control; environmental policy; forest management; fruit; gender; governance approach; participatory approach; Burkina Faso","Westholm, L.; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, P.O.

Descriptive statistics and econometric techniques such as probit, tobit, and Heckman two-step selection models were used to analyze the data. The study finds that households derive a significant portion of their income from the collection of NTFPs; however, the extent and pattern of household dependence on NTFPs for income differ widely across different socioeconomic and demographic profiles. Level of education, age, landholding and household size, number of children, and gender influence the intensity of household collection of NTFPs. Households located inside the core zone of the reserve tend to depend more on NTFP collection compared to households residing in the buffer zone. Provision of non-farm employment and adequate farm land will go a long way in reducing household dependence on NTFPs and thereby improve forest conservation outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Demographic variables; Forest products; India; Livelihoods; Odisha; Protected areas; Similipal","Conservation; Economic analysis; Education; Population statistics; Timber; Demographic variables; Forest products; India; Livelihoods; Odisha; Protected areas; Similipal; Forestry","Dash, M.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, India; email: madhuu.dash@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Based on research conducted in arid areas of north-western Namibia with indigenous Himba communities, this paper assesses the social and economic effects of commercialising the traditional perfume plant Commiphora wildii, used by Himba as part of a daily personal care ritual. Results show improved access to food, education and health care as a result of the income gained and increased benefits to women, but also illustrate the complexities and inter-related nature of many components and the difficulties of drawing generalised conclusions. These results concur with literature showing that NTFP commercialisation is an important strategy to diversify livelihoods and thus decrease vulnerability to climate variability and food insecurity. Although some negative effects are reported, we conclude that the enterprise contributes to the social and cultural integrity and well-being of the harvesters. We emphasise the importance of examining initiatives on a case-by-case basis and of being especially attuned to the unique circumstances of indigenous peoples in remote regions who remain one step removed from monetary economies.","gender; indigenous peoples; livelihoods; non-timber forest products; traditional knowledge","accessibility; angiosperm; commercialization; cultural economy; cultural tradition; indigenous population; material culture; nontimber forest product; traditional knowledge; Namibia; Commiphora",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Due to extreme local endemism and anthropogenic destructive harvesting of resin, the species is categorized as critically endangered. The present study investigated the biotic limiting factors of recruitment of V. inidica in its natural populations, and studied the pattern of anthropogenic harvest of nuts of V. indica in the recent past. Seed predation and seedling herbivory particularly by insects were assessed. The sustainability of the nut harvest was assessed by conducting pre- and post-harvest censuses of nuts on forest floors. Over 90 % of the fruits of V. indica were infested by the insects, but, only about 10 % of the infested fruits were seed-predated. Seedling herbivores included a leaf miner, ants of two species, and larvae of a lymantrid moth. Seedling mortality due to herbivores was moderate (45.5 %). Pre- and post-harvest censuses showed that only 3.81 % of the fruits that were naturally-fallen on the forest floor were spared after the harvest had taken place. Sringeri has exported 820 metric tons of nuts in the study year, which was an all-time high estimate. The study concludes that the anthropogenic nut collection can hamper the population structure of V. indica locally. Since V. indica has an alternate-year major flowering cycle, the seed loss as seen in the present study is critical. Raising plantations of V. indica as an afforestation program can contribute to the conservation of the species and the development of local communities. © 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.","Anthropogenic nut collection; Dipterocarpaceae; Non-timber forest products; NTFP; Seed predation; Seedling herbivory",,"Sinu, P.A.; Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, Srirampura, Jakkur Post, India; email: sinupa@gmail.com",,"Springer India",03698211,,,,"English","Proc.

Various actors, both international and national, have gathered to propose major changes to the forestry law in order to support NTFP development. This paper addresses the following questions: (1) What are the provisions of the current forestry policy for NTFPs? (2) What are the major changes proposed for NTFPs and the reality on the ground? (3) How do forest users view the legal forestry framework? (4) Aren't there better ways to improve NTFP management in Cameroon? Informal and formal interviews held with producers, traders, forest administrative agents and civil society actors show that the government tends to address the local communities' participation concerns through decentralisation in the forestry sector but without guaranteeing an efficient implementation. This situation appears to be a structural factor affecting other sectors of activity in the country, and resulting in little hope that the long awaited reforms in the forestry sector will have a determining impact, unless critical actions are taken against corruption and nepotism. The development of a well-structured civil society and the recourse to new technologies appear to be the best way to improve NTFP governance and efficiency in Cameroon.","civil society; efficiency; governance; national economy; NTFPs; policy reforms; producers","civil society; forest management; forestry policy; governance approach; national economy; nontimber forest product; policy reform; regulatory framework; Cameroon","Awono, A.; University of Paul-Valéry, Route De Mende 34199, France; email: abdonawono@gmail.com",,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

This article explores the integration of NTFPs into forest policy discourse in Mexico as a strategy to support livelihood, conservation and cultural goals. Building on the scientific global literature on the subject, we identified 13 prominent NTFP management questions, including the ecological impacts of marketing NTFPs, the distribution of benefits of NTFP production among local populations, and rights of access to NTFP collection. To structure the analysis of Mexican policy we addressed these questions and processed three general dimensions most relevant to policy implementation - these are associated with the oftentimes competing policy goals of supporting rural people's livelihoods, environmental conservation, and strengthening culture (not only of indigenous peoples, but rural people in general). Subsequently we performed an evaluation of key forest policy instruments in Mexico, based on the three dimensions identified, in the effort to learn how successfully forest policy has integrated these dimensions. We conclude that although NTFPs are integrated into Mexican forest policy, drawbacks to their integration remain, related to the diversity in the nature, scale and marketing of these products, as well as to the diversity of local actors involved. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Forest conservation; Forest policy; Mexico, local culture; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Rural livelihoods","Commerce; Conservation; Ecology; Marketing; Timber; Forest conservation; Forest policy; Me-xico; Non-timber forest products; Rural livelihood; Forestry","Delgado, T.S.; Posgrado en Geografía, Antigua Carretera a Pátzcuaro No. 8701, Col.

A combination of literature review and in-depth data collated by CIFOR from households and markets for different periods corresponding to specific NTFP funded projects in Cameroon was used. The results show that NTFPs constitute a regular source of income (even though not the most important) for rural households due to their diversity. About 38% of vegetal NTFPs are used as food and the annual economic value for 16 of them is estimated at 32 billion XAF (64.7 million USD).

These interactions, in turn, lead to diverse environmental effects. Few studies focus on these practices in the context of harvesting NTFPs, product properties and environmental impacts, including biological invasions. In Pine woodlands in Eastern Bhutan, Cymbopogon flexuosus East Indian Lemon Grass is harvested and distilled to obtain essential oil, an economically important NTFP. Prescribed fires are applied in late winter (before annual harvest in summer) to induce regeneration of new tillers with increased essential oil content. This practice is based on local ecological knowledge and renders the utilization of C. flexuosus economically viable. On two sites with contrasting stand structure, we evaluated the effects of different prescribed burning regimes (no burning vs. burning with two levels of frequency and intensity) on the sustainability of annually harvested C. flexuosus, regarding cover, biomass yield, essential oil yield and quality. At the same time, we evaluated the effects of prescribed burning on the spread of the invasive shrub Chromolaena odorata. Cymbopogon flexuosus biomass declined over time, likely as a result of harvesting. In more closed stands, it was moreover marginally negatively influenced by fire. We confirmed local ecological knowledge regarding significantly higher essential oil yield on burned plots, without differences between fire regimes. In open stands, fire led to rapid expansion of C. odorata, specifically with frequently applied, higher intensity fires. Additionally, the spread of C. odorata showed adverse effects on C. flexuosus cover. Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the importance of studying the wider impacts of non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvest. We confirmed local ecological knowledge that fire increases lemon grass essential oil yield, making prescribed burning an attractive land management tool for farmers. Nevertheless, the practice of annual harvesting may lead to resource decline that may be exacerbated by fire in closed stands. Caution needs to be practiced on open sites where invasive C. odorata may spread rapidly after fires. Management needs to focus on preventing concentration of annual harvesting and associated prescribed burning in the same areas. Amending national forestry rules to legalize fire as a land management tool can support local economies and potentially prevent wildfires that regularly devastate human infrastructure across eastern Bhutan. © 2016 The Authors.

Information on the patterns of tree community structure differences in these zones is helpful to evaluate the conservation efficacy. Our study was implemented within a biodiversity hotspot, in the Ta Xua Nature Reserve of north-western Vietnam, which has a statutorily protected core zone and a buffer zone, where local H'Mong people are permitted low intensity forest use. The forests are rich in tree species (249 observed). Many of these tree species provide non-timber forest products (NTFPs) (48%) or valuable timber (22%), and 18 species are red-listed. Overall tree density was not different in the two zones, but tree diameter and species richness were lower in the buffer zone. At the tree level, logistic regression analysis indicated that red-listed status, large diameter, and low density of conspecifics increased the probability of tree absence from the buffer zone but not the potential use as a NTFP. However, most NTFP species had different densities in the core and buffer zones, and this correlated with signs of human interference. At the species level, the density of species was the most important variable, and rarity strongly increased the probability of species absence. Our results also indicate that rare and red-listed trees were depleted in the buffer zone. In consideration of conservation goals, the future monitoring of these species at the Ta Xua Nature Reserve and other protected areas is needed, and conservation measures most likely need to be improved. © 2016 The Authors","Conservation; Diversity; Logistic model; Non-timber forest products; Rarity; Timber",,"Dao, T.H.H.; Tropical Silviculture and Forest Ecology, Büsgenweg 1, Germany; email: tdao@gwdg.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

The increasing demand for these artisanal goods is stimulating the emergence of an informal market for immature buriti leaves, leading to an intensification of their extraction and resulting in negative effects on local buriti palm populations and the ecosystem. Thus, the objective of the present study was to assess the environmental value of the buriti palm tree based on the maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for its conservation, using the contingent valuation method. Among the respondents, 99.74% reported that the palm species should be protected and the majority of them (65.75%) agreed to pay for its conservation (annual WTP R$ 179.49 ± 222.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the WTP was not influenced by the socio-economic profile of the respondents. The main reasons for non-WTP are related to dissatisfaction with the government and the belief that financial contributions would not solve problems of environmental damage. Overall, the evaluated population believes that environmental conservation is not an obligation of the government or that of the population, but is a collective responsibility. © 2016, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined meso-scale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 × 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km2 grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live aboveground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha−1 (range: 0–28.1 Mg ha−1). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Arecaceae; Arecoideae; Biomass; Canopy palm; Meso-scale distribution; Palm community","Biomass; Conservation; Sustainable development; Timber; Arecaceae; Arecoideae; Canopy palm; Meso scale; Palm community; Forestry; aboveground biomass; agroforestry; arboreal species; biochemical composition; commercialization; dispersal; emission control; evergreen tree; forest canopy; geographical distribution; plant community; protected area; sustainable forestry; timber harvesting; tropical forest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Arecaceae; Arecoideae; Bactris maraja; Euterpe oleracea; Oenocarpus; Oenocarpus bacaba; Oenocarpus bataua","Norris, D.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Biodiversidade Tropical, Rod.

Many species within these forests suffer regeneration problems due to unsustainable management regimes. In particular, a regeneration problem has been detected in a forest of tara (Caesalpinia spinosa), a neotropical tree of high ecological and economic value, in Atiquipa (Peru). The study of the spatial patterns and population structure of forests can help us understand their dynamics and evaluate the effects of management. In this article, we analyse the stand demographic structure, spatial distribution and patterns of plant-plant interactions in tara forests. We evaluate whether the regeneration problem in Atiquipa is strictly local or a problem of general concern and investigate the most probable causes. Four tara stands were selected at different localities in Peru. Two stands (Andurco and Polán) had a reverse J-shaped diametric structure, typical of stable self-replacing forests, although Polán had a low number of young trees, indicating an incipient regeneration problem. The Lloque histogram was skewed (with a maximum in seedlings ⩽1 cm), indicating over-exploitation in the past and present forest regeneration. Maguey had a low number of regenerates, with peaks in some intermediate diametric classes, which may indicate natural regeneration problems or some past management. Spatial distribution of tara trees did not depart from the null model (≈random distribution), typical of trees dispersed by zoochory. Maguey was an exception, showing a regular pattern at short distances, possibly associated with past management (like selective cuttings and/or plantations). These results suggest that in most of the analysed stands the current forest management (i.e. excessive seed collection or grazing) limits tara forest regeneration. However, the only stand with a protected status presented a clear tendency toward population increase. Bivariate analyses revealed an aggregated pattern between seedlings and adult trees. Moreover, the plant-plant interaction study showed that seedlings were associated with woody vegetation. These positive associations highlight a facilitative effect that ameliorates stressful microclimatic characteristics and/or protects tara seedlings from herbivory. The results of this study support some recommendations for sustainable management, such as controlled stocking rate, limited seed collection and promotion of bush cover. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Facilitation; NTFP; O-ring statistics; Regeneration; Spatial pattern; Tropical dry forest","Ecology; Ecosystems; O rings; Population statistics; Reforestation; Seed; Spatial distribution; Facilitation; NTFP; Regeneration; Spatial patterns; Tropical dry forest; Forestry; demography; dry forest; facilitation; forest ecosystem; forest management; forest product; legume; microclimate; population structure; regrowth; seed collection; seedling; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; statistical analysis; tropical forest; zoochory; Peru; Caesalpinia spinosa","Cordero, I.; Instituto de Ciencias Agrarias, Calle Serrano 115 bis, Spain; email: cordero.irene@ica.csic.es",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Although many studies have been conducted both nationally and regionally on issues of food insecurity in the Congo Basin, little is known on the effects of timber exploitation on household food insecurity statues of forest dependent communities in this region. This study focused on the determination of the principal indicators of household food security status of populations living around six selected forest concessions in the Congo Basin. Method: We randomly surveyed 724 households in thirty-four communities living in six popular forest concessions around the Congo Basin. Food consumption pattern data was collected using a validated food-frequency questionnaire in 2012. Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence (HFIAP) was assessed using the HFIAP indicator and households were categorized into four levels of household food insecurity status as follows: Food secure (HFIAS = 0); mildly food insecure (HFIAS 1-8); moderately food insecure (HFIAS 9-13); and severely food insecure (HFIAS 14-27). Results: The majority of the households interviewed were headed by women (73.1 %, 76.6 %, and 58.6 % for Cameroon, DRC and Gabon respectively), most of them married (84.6 %, 100 %, 57.6 % for Cameroon, DRC and Gabon respectively) with an average age range of 30-49 years. Most of the household members were engaged in farming and/or illegal logging as the main revenue generating activities. Results of global household food insecurity categorized 63.8 % of households in Cameroon as fully food secure and 36 % as food insecure. In the DRC (92.9 %) and Gabon (92.7 %), almost all the survey households were categorized as either moderately or severely food insecure; clearly elucidating the existence of severe insufficiency in the quantity and quality of food meant for human nutrition in these areas. The means of household food insecurity scores for the DRC (17.40 ± 4.15) and Gabon (14.9 ± 5.87) were significantly higher when compared to the average score for Cameroon ((7.55 ± 6.62) at p < 0.0001. This literally means that many of the households especially in DRC and Gabon face enormous difficulties in obtaining an adequate dietary energy supply. Gender (female), educational level (illiterate), and age (young) were positively correlated to food insecurity levels. Conclusion: Our results revealed that, despite the potential contribution of the Congo Basin forests, through enhancing access to different forms of quality foods such as bush meat, wild foods, and medicine, not forgetting the provision of agricultural land, local construction material, and income generation resources, the prevalence of food insecurity among the population adjoining forest concessions in the region is severe. This prevalence is alarming around forest concessions of the DRC and Gabon and in one concession of Cameroon. Given that poverty and poor education were positively correlated to household food insecurity, they were considered the paramount determinants of household food insecurity in this region. © 2016 The Author(s).","Congo Basin; Food insecurity; Forest concessions; Forest-dwellers; Household",,"Ngondi, J.L.; Department of Biochemistry, Cameroon; email: ngondijudithl@hotmail.com",,"BioMed Central",20550928,,,,"English","BMC Nutr.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060479706

In-depth semistructured interviews were conducted in two contrasting, but representative, villages, where traditional mixed-crop farming was being replaced by cash crops such as coffee, maize, and cotton. Access to state-subsidized food supply and increase in cash income through wage labor, coupled with increasing depredation of food crops by wild animals, were some causes for the shift to cash crops. Declining supply of non-timber forest produce (NTFP) and the subsistence cash it provided has also impacted farmer livelihoods and indirectly contributed to this shift. The changing aspirations of younger Soligas and inadequate state support for mixed-crop farming also could be contributing factors. Soligas consistently maintained that increased wildlife depredation of food crops, reduction in supplies of wild foods, and the decline in NTFP was due to poor forest health. The transition to cash crops improved cash flows but exposed the Soligas to market risks. While food security also improved, the nutritional quality of diet declined. Soligas are adopting new farming practices, diets, and livelihood strategies, and importantly, leveraging rights historically denied to them, all a reflection of their social resilience. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","Adivasis; Karnataka; livelihoods; rainfed farming; tiger reserve",,"Mundoli, S.; School of Development, India; email: seema.mundoli@apu.edu.in",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",21683565,,,,"English","Agroecology Sustainable Food Syst.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84982198069

In several cases, the same species can be harvested for NTFP and also logged for timber. Three decades of studies on the sustainability of NTFP harvest for local people’s livelihood have failed to successfully integrate these socio-economic and ecological factors. We apply optimal control theory to investigate optimal strategies for the combinations of non-lethal (e.g., NTFP) and lethal (e.g., timber) harvest that minimize the cost of harvesting while maximizing the benefits (revenue) that accrue to harvesters and the conservation value of harvested ecosystems. Optimal harvesting strategies include starting with non-lethal NTFP harvest and postponing lethal timber harvesting to begin after a few years. We clearly demonstrate that slow growth species have lower optimal harvesting rates, objective functional values and profits than fast growth species. However, contrary to expectation, the effect of species lifespan on optimal harvesting rates was weak suggesting that life history is a better indicator of species resilience to harvest than lifespan. Overall, lethal or nonlethal harvest rates must be <40 % to ensure optimality. This optimal rate is lower than commonly reported sustainable harvest rates for non-timber forest products. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Differential equations model; Harvest model; Life history; Lifespan; Non-timber forest products; Optimal control theory; Sustainable timber harvest","forest management; growth response; life history; nontimber forest product; sustainability; sustainable forestry; timber harvesting; tropical environment","Gaoue, O.G.; Department of Botany, United States; email: ogaoue@hawaii.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",18741738,,,,"English","Theor.

In the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot of Brazil, non-governmental organizations, researchers and community leaders are encouraging the commercialization of fruit pulp-based products from the endangered palm Euterpe edulis, known as juçara, to replace income from illegal heart of palm extraction. In order to assess the governance of development of juçara pulp as an NTFP and the potential to increase conservation of juçara through management on smallholder properties, we conducted qualitative research in São Paulo State from October 2012 to October 2013. Major challenges include policy barriers, difficulties integrating production and commercialization, problematic assumptions about poverty alleviation and the inability of the most disadvantaged members of communities to benefit. These governance challenges are a function of poor access, or the 'bundle of powers' that enables the ability to benefit. However, engagement with juçara fruit pulp production links farmers and former poachers with sustainable agricultural concepts and with networks, changing their perceptions of conservation and enhancing ability to benefit from improved policy. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2016.","Atlantic Forest; community-based conservation; Euterpe edulis; forest governance; social capital; sustainable development","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Complex networks; Fruits; Research and development management; Sustainable development; Timber; Atlantic forest; Community-based conservations; Euterpe edulis; Forest governance; Social capitals; Forestry; biodiversity; commercialization; conservation management; exploitation; forest cover; forest product; fruit; governance approach; monocotyledon; perception; policy making; poverty alleviation; qualitative analysis; rural area; rural population; social capital; sustainable development; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Agonidae; Ara; Euterpe edulis","Ball, A.A.Rua Diogo Jácome, Brazil; email: alaine.ball@gmail.com",,"Cambridge University Press",03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

Bamboos account for 12.8 percent approximately of the total forest cover in India. The North-Eastern Hill (NEH) region harbors more than 66 percent of the Indian bamboo genetic resources. Out of 125 bamboo sp. available in India, 8.4 taxa are found in NEH region. Mizoram occupies the largest forest area (30.8%) under different bamboo species, followed by Meghalaya with 26.0 percent. The gregarious bamboo flowering of Melocanna baccifera or Mautam occurs periodically after every 48±1 years and causes ecological imbalance in NEH region comprising seven contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Nagaland. Bamboo plants die after flowering and fruiting, leaving bare and exposed soil, which is disastrous in mountainous states. Secondly, rodents feed on the flowers and seeds of the dying bamboo, leading to a rapid growth in their numbers, which migrate toward agricultural fields, granaries and destroy standing crops and stored grains. The destruction of crops results in food scarcity and famine. The epidemiological imbalance also leads to increased risk of infection in man and animals or outbreak of rodent-borne diseases. The modes of transmission are through rat bite, insect vector bites, fleas and other ecto-parasites or contamination of food, water and air by rodent urine or excreta. Some of these diseases require immediate control measures to minimize the morbidity and mortality in local inhabitants. From historical or scientific records, it is believed that masting of Mau bamboo-M. baccifera occurred across north-eastern India in 1815, 1863, 1911, and 1959. A Melocanna masting event occurred on schedule in Mizoram in 2006-09. The crops suffered massive damage, with yields at 30 year low. It was reported that spontaneous increase in rodent population due to high nutritive value of bamboo fruits, reduction in cannibalism due to the availability of plenty of food during bamboo flowering and change in the ecological conditions resulting in 'r'-pattern of rodent breeding might be the probable reasons for the rodent outbreaks. The rodent fauna of the Indian sub-continent is represented by 46 genera and 128 species. Out of 18 commensal rodents, Rattus rattus is the most predominant species. In NEH region, Rattus spp. forms about 45% of the total rodent population (specially, R. nitidus-24.51%) followed by Mus spp. (16.9% M. musculus) and Bandicota bengalensis (lesser bandicoot rat) about 31.5%. Rodents responsible for famine in the years of bamboo flowering are R. rattus, R. nitidus, R. niviventer and R. r. brunnellsculus. Mizoram was under threat during bamboo flowering because Myanmar-a high risk area for transmission of plague, salmonellosis being endemic in Mizoram with frequent food poisoning outbreaks, gastroenteritis being second leading health problem indicates unsafe food and drinking practices. Higher attitudes and practices of people towards rodents including consumption of their flesh, difficult terrains and inaccessible remote or interior villages with poor health facilities were the real threats for the transmission of rodent-borne diseases. The state had prepared a series of Bamboo Flowering and Famine Combat Schemes (BAFFACOS) in 2005 for inter-sectoral coordination with various departments like agriculture, health, rural works and public works. A central team of rodent and rodent-borne disease experts from CAZRI, Jodhpur; NIPHM, Hyderabad and National Centre for Disease Control, Plague Surveillance Unit, Bangalore, visited Mizoram several times during 2006-2009 for making on the spot assessment, to demonstrate rodent pest management and surveillance, prevention and control of rodent-borne diseases in the region and to train the workers involved in surveillance and control works. © ADR Journals 2016.

Timber also represents an important source of income from this species. Generally, P. pinea stands have been managed to maximize either timber or seed production, optimization of the joint production of both products being rare. The difficulty in optimizing seed or joint production is the highly stochastic masting habit of P. pinea. The aim of the present study was to find the optimal management of P. pinea stands from the economic point of view when both seed and timber production are considered. A growth and yield model was employed to simulate the dynamics of P. pinea stands of the northern Iberian Peninsula. The novelty of the study is the implementation of a cone yield model that is able to predict expected cone harvests and seed yields when masting is stochastic. The model was linked with an optimization algorithm to obtain optimal schedules for two different stands. The results showed that seed production of P. pinea in the northern plateau of the Iberian Peninsula may increase the soil expectation value by more than 300 % in dense stands and 200 % in sparse stands. When seed yields were considered, rotation lengths were longer and thinnings were delayed. The results were highly sensitive to cone prices and discount rates. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Edible seeds; Masting; NWFP; Piñones; Stochastic optimization","Pinus pinea","Pasalodos-Tato, M.; Centro de Investigación Forestal (CIFOR), Crta. de la Coruña, km 7.5, Spain; email: pasalodos.maria@inia.es",,"Springer Verlag",16124669,,,,"English","Eur.

Harvesting methods that maximize yield while they fulfill local objectives and ensure sustainability are a research priority. Documenting local ecological knowledge on the species and identifying local users’ goals for its production, we defined three harvesting treatments (selective cut, horseshoe cut, clear cut) and experimentally compared them with a no-intervention control treatment in an action research framework. We implemented harvesting over three seasons and monitored annually and two years post-treatment. Even though the total number of culms positively influenced the number of shoots regenerated, a much stronger relationship was detected between the number of culms harvested and the number of shoots regenerated, indicating compensatory growth mechanisms to guide shoot regeneration. Shoot recruitment declined over time in all treatments as well as the control; however, there was no difference among harvest treatments. Culm recruitment declined with an increase in harvesting intensity. When univariately assessing the number of harvested culms and shoots, there were no differences among treatments. However, multivariate analyses simultaneously considering both variables showed that harvested output of shoots and culms was higher with clear cut and horseshoe cut as compared to selective cut. Given the ease of implementation and issues of work safety, users preferred the horseshoe cut, but the lack of sustainability of shoot production calls for investigating longer cutting cycles. © 2016, The Author(s).","Bamboo silviculture; Dendrocalamus hamiltonii; Local ecological knowledge; NTFP harvesting; Participatory action research","Bamboo; Ecology; Multivariant analysis; Sustainable development; Compensatory growth; Dendrocalamus hamiltonii; Local ecological knowledge; Multi variate analysis; Participatory action research; Poverty alleviation; Research priorities; Shoot regeneration; Harvesting; bamboo; harvesting; participatory approach; poverty alleviation; recruitment (population dynamics); regeneration; shoot; silviculture; stem; sustainability; bamboo; controlled study; experimental model; human; multivariate analysis; safety; season; shoot regeneration; species; agriculture; attitude to health; Bhutan; climate; ecology; ecosystem; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; Poaceae; procedures; Dendrocalamus hamiltonii; Agriculture; Bhutan; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Poaceae; Seasons","Darabant, A.; Department of Forest and Soil Sciences, Peter Jordan Strasse 82, Austria; email: darabant@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"27113084","English","Environ.

The tested models can then be used to simulate how agro-ecosystems will respond to changes in the environment and management. In this study, we used baseline datasets generated from the NWFP to validate the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum System (SPACSYS) model in relation to the dynamics of soil water content, water loss from runoff and forage biomass removal. The validated model, together with future climate scenarios for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s (from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES): medium (A1B) and large (A1F1) emission scenarios), were used to simulate the long-term responses of the system with three contrasting treatments on the NWFP. Simulation results demonstrated that the SPACSYS model could estimate reliably the dynamics of soil water content, water loss from runoff and drainage, and cut biomass for a permanent sward. The treatments responded in different ways under the climate change scenarios. More carbon (C) is fixed and respired by the swards treated with an increased use of legumes, whereas less C was lost through soil respiration with the planned reseeding. The deep-rooting grass in the reseeding treatment reduced N losses through leaching, runoff and gaseous emissions, and water loss from runoff compared with the other two treatments. © 2015 The Authors.

The main resource obtained from the species is the fruits that are harvested from wild populations for human consumption. Across its distribution area adults are most frequently felled to obtain the racemes, which may affect the palm’s populations. In this paper we studied the demography of two populations of Oenocarpus bataua to assess the harvest potential of its fruits and the density variation in different habitats in the western Amazon to estimate fruit yields in different forest types. Non-inundated lands held the greatest densities with an average of 11 adults ha−1 (0–132 adults ha−1). The population finite growth rate (λ) in Amacayacu, Colombia, was 0.9103 because of slow growth and low survival of stemless individuals and low recruitment. On the contrary, in Yasuní, Ecuador, we found a growing population with λ = 1.0368. According to our simulations, adult felling reduced transient population growth (λt) in both populations, especially when harvest was frequent even at low intensities. In Amacayacu a simulated harvest of 60 % year−1 of the fruits by climbing did not modify λt substantially, while in Yasuní, a regime of 80 % of annual harvest did not diminish λt below one and the initial number of adults. The results help to understand the demography of useful palms and to address sustainable management.

Its remit is to research agricultural productivity and ecosystem responses to different management practices for beef and sheep production in lowland grasslands. A system based on permanent pasture was implemented on three 21-ha farmlets to obtain baseline data on hydrology, nutrient cycling and productivity for 2 years. Since then two farmlets have been modified by either (i) planned reseeding with grasses that have been bred for enhanced sugar content or deep-rooting traits or (ii) sowing grass and legume mixtures to reduce nitrogen fertilizer inputs. The quantities of nutrients that enter, cycle within and leave the farmlets were evaluated with data recorded from sensor technologies coupled with more traditional field study methods. We demonstrate the potential of the farm platform approach with a case study in which we investigate the effects of the weather, field topography and farm management activity on surface runoff and associated pollutant or nutrient loss from soil. We have the opportunity to do a full nutrient cycling analysis, taking account of nutrient transformations in soil, and flows to water and losses to air. The NWFP monitoring system is unique in both scale and scope for a managed land-based capability that brings together several technologies that allow the effect of temperate grassland farming systems on soil moisture levels, runoff and associated water quality dynamics to be studied in detail. Highlights: Can meat production systems be developed that are productive yet minimize losses to the environment? The data are from an intensively instrumented capability, which is globally unique and topical. We use sensing technologies and surveys to show the effect of pasture renewal on nutrient losses. Platforms provide evidence of the effect of meteorology, topography and farm activity on nutrient loss. © 2016 The Authors.

However, exploiting NTFPs involves challenges, including successful insertion of products into conventional markets, accommodating legal or traditional–use restrictions, and negotiating access to traditionally occupied territories. Some of these restrictions are due to the creation of conservation units. Here we present information on the effects of creation of a conservation unit on the viability of an NTFP–extraction initiative by the members of the Artisans Association of Novo Airão (AANA), Amazonas State, Brazilian Amazon. Those artisans make vegetable fiber handicrafts using the leafstalks of arumã (Ischnosiphon polyphyllus – Marantaceae), which is common in seasonally flooded areas near Novo Airão. Conservation areas surround the town of Novo Airão and AANA members are prohibited from harvesting arumã leafstalks in these areas. In 2000, alternative areas for harvesting were suggested by environmental institutes, and management of arumã was concentrated along four rainforest streams close to Novo Airão. Harvest sites were monitored for three years, but there was no increase in growth rate as a result of harvesting, and leafstalk density did not completely recover between samples. High growth rates of arumã leafstalks suitable for handicraft manufacture are found only in areas where people manage the tree cover, but these practices are not permitted by current legislation, even in areas outside conservation units. To obtain arumã using traditionally sustainable methods, AANA requires the right to work and manage forests in protected areas. The lack of regionally appropriate public and environmental policy has resulted in a major impediment to a sustainable and locally run development activity. © 2016, The New York Botanical Garden.","ethnobotany; handicrafts; Non–timber forest product; resource rights; traditional peoples",,"Nakazono, E.M.; Universidade Estadual do Maranhão — UEMABrazil; email: emnakazono@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

In Vietnam, the government implemented a pilot Benefit Sharing Mechanism (BSM) in Special Use Forests (SUFs), to develop a legal framework for sharing the benefits, rights, and responsibilities of forest conservation and management with local communities. One of the pilot areas is in Bach Ma National Park. We examined community involvement in the BSM pilot scheme in SUFs in the buffer zone of Bach Ma National Park located in Thuong Nhat commune, Nam Dong District. Sixty household surveys from two villages were undertaken in 2014. Most households agreed there were benefits, but some reported difficulties. Analysis of harvested non-timber forest products (NTFPs) showed a nearly 30% increase in average household income, based on regulated access to harvesting NTFPs by registered forest users. The difficulties experienced by those involved in the BSM pilot scheme included declining meeting attendance, infrequent meetings, harvested amounts of some NTFPs exceeding those allowed by the Benefit Sharing Arrangement, and forest protection teams failing to detect such irregularities. Finally, we suggest a number of improvements to BSM policies, such as incentives for forest protection team members to be more actively involved in harvest monitoring. © 2016, Mongaby.com e-journal.

We claim that there is a large unused potential for NWFP to support rural development and increase incomes of land owners and rural enterprises. In this article, we study what makes selected and so far successful product innovations in NWFPs special and subsequently what were the factors that supported their development and marketing? These questions we study at hand of four empirical innovative case studies in four European rural areas. We come to the conclusion that the entrepreneurs show some common features in the ways they started their business. However, they have applied individual strategies for the realisation of their own ideas. In line with recommendations from recent literature on creating innovations, all of them have used some ""external"" support, but at very different levels: They range from monetary support and consultation of effective support organisations to personal non-monetary exchange-relationships in social networks within a communal area.

Based on empirical investigation, our study revealed that local communities gather a substantial amount of NTFPs from national park despite the official restrictions. Twenty seven percent households (HHs) of the area received at least some cash benefit from the collection, processing and selling of NTFPs, and NTFPs contribute to HHs' primary, supplementary and emergency sources of income. NTFPs also constituted an estimated 19% of HHs' net annual income, and were the primary occupation for about 18% of the HHs. HHs' dependency on nearby forests for various NTFPs varied vis-à-vis their socio-economic condition, as well as with their location from the park.

This methodology has been applied successfully in forest products harvesting such as timber logging. However, modelling harvest through a loss term is not appropriate for non-timber forest products (NTFP) since harvesting in this case does not always require the complete removal of individual plants. Empirical evidence suggest that NTFP harvest affects plant population growth rates. Additionally, timber and NTFP harvest can have synergistic effects on population dynamics. We develop and analyse a simple model that incorporates non-lethal harvest implicitly through the population growth rate of plants and lethal harvest explicitly through permanent removal of whole plants, with additional synergistic effects on population growth rate. To capture transient dynamics, we model the growth rate of plants explicitly as a dynamic variable affected by harvesting. Transient dynamics results indicate that populations have delayed response to discrete harvesting. We demonstrate exactly how the sustainability of lethal harvest, non-lethal harvest or both types of harvests depends on the demographic effect of each type of harvest on the population growth rate. Finally, we identify a threshold parameter R, such that combined lethal and non-lethal harvest results in plant population sustainability when R>1 and extinction when R≤1. © 2016 British Ecological Society.","Harvest model; Logistic growth; Non-lethal demographic cost; Non-timber forest products; Sustainability threshold; Sustainable resource exploitation",,"Gaoue, O.G.; Department of Botany, United States; email: ogaoue@hawaii.edu",,"British Ecological Society",2041210X,,,,"English","Methods Ecol.

Study was carried out in six villages of upper Kedarnath valley at an altitudinal gradient of 1400–2800. Paper examines the nature and extent of provisioning services from forests to hill locals living in nearby villages. Frequent field survey of 151 households from five villages in proximity to forest was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires followed by field surveys. Primary data were collected for basic household’s attributes, fuelwood, fodder, leaf litter and NTFP collection pattern. Simple descriptive methods were used for data analysis. The result shows that fuelwood contributes more than 95 % of total domestic fuel requirement in the study area with more collection during summers but more consumption during winter months due to extensive drop in day and night temperatures. Fodder collection is a major practice adding a lot to women drudgery, and winter fodder deficit is a major issue that leads to dry fodder collection from remote locations. Similarly the average seasonal collection figures were also high for leaf litter ranging from 120 to 89 kg/household/day. Collection of wild edibles is moderate, while for medicinal plants is low in the study area. Resource availability, collection and consumption depend on the family size, distance from forest area and economic condition of the household.

Deforested areas were delineated by satellite image interpretation of forest cover change. A questionnaire survey was conducted for 161 households in six villages within three districts having varying degrees of forest cover changes per capita over a period of 5 years. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze characteristics of households affected by deforestation in their fuelwood and NTFP collections. The characteristics vary with the collection activity examined, either fuelwood or NTFP collection. We revealed that deforestation notably affects villagers whose non-forest fuelwood sources are scarce. People who collected fuelwood in forests after deforestation are more likely to be affected if the remaining forest area per capita near their village is less. In contrast, for NTFP collection, the size of the deforested area per capita near villages is more important than that of the remaining forest area, particularly to those who depend on NTFP collection as one of their main livelihood activities before deforestation. In contrast with much of the literature that has stated that the poor depend more on NTFPs, our results show that the relationship between household wealth and NTFP dependence was more than a simple negative correlation; i.e., the local people's material wealth was not a strong determinant in our NTFP model. The importance of stakeholder analysis and consultation with local residents in impact assessments and natural resource management involving land-use changes has been progressively acknowledged in the academic literature. In this context, we argue that it is essential to identify potentially affected groups among local residents in terms of their fuelwood and NTFP collections in a short-term period widely distributed at the provincial level. The combination of our findings, method applied and existing demographic survey networks in Cambodia provides an approach of identifying the affected residents in a transparent manner. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Fuelwood; GIS; Impact assessments; Non-timber forest products; Remote sensing; Stakeholder analysis","deforestation; forest cover; fuelwood; GIS; household survey; nontimber forest product; questionnaire survey; remote sensing; satellite imagery; Cambodia; Kampong Thum; Oroxylum indicum","Ehara, M.; Graduate School of Social and Cultural Studies, 774 Motooka, Japan; email: makotoehara1@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960480816

In Finland, bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) are among the most important NWFPs, and yield models for them have been estimated and linked into forest simulators. So far, berry yield models have not been evaluated using independent data that were not used in model estimation. In this study, independent data on berry yields, as well as stand and site characteristics used as predictors in yield models, were measured from a total of 230 sample plots in North Karelia, Finland. The predictions of four bilberry and four cowberry models published previously were evaluated on the basis of the models' prediction bias, precision and applicability in locating the best berry stands for picking. The bias and precision of the models varied highly. Due to bias, the models should be calibrated before applying them in forest decision support systems. The models for bilberry located the best berry stands more reliably than did those for cowberry. Visits to twice as many stands, as guided by the models, were needed to harvest a given amount of bilberries, but, for cowberry, the number of stands to be visited was four-fold in comparison to the situation where the measured yields were known. Besides the forest inventory data measured in the field, we also used the freely available multi-source national forest inventory (MS-NFI) data covering the whole of Finland as input data for the berry models. Both data sets were equally suitable to be used as the input data for the berry models. © 2015 .","Decision support; Model validation; Multiple use forest management; Non-wood forest products; Wild berries","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Fruits; Input output programs; Decision supports; Model validation; Multiple use; Non-wood forest products; Wild berries; Forestry; decision support system; field survey; forest inventory; forest management; forest resource; forestry modeling; fruit; harvesting; model validation; multiple use; nontimber forest product; prediction; shrub; yield; Finland; Pohjois-Karjala; Vaccinium myrtillus; Vaccinium vitis-idaea","Kilpeläinen, H.; Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Yliopistokatu 6, Finland; email: harri.kilpelainen@luke.fi",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

They can be picked freely by forest visitors for their own use, irrespective of forest ownership. There is a century long tradition of foraging for wild food in the Czech forests and this article presents an analysis of the trends in the apparent socio-economic importance of the collection and use of NTFP for the inhabitants in the CR over the last 20 years.Data concerning the collection and use of NTFP in the CR have been systematically analysed every year since 1994 and, thus, a unique time series, even on the European level, has been obtained. The results of the analyses demonstrate that NTFP collection is an important activity for the inhabitants of the CR. Investigations based on questionnaire surveys in representative samples of CR citizens (quota selection) show that about 3/4 of the households report collecting NTFP. On average, 10.6. kg of principal NTFP (mushrooms and berries) were picked by every household annually in 1994-2013, which amounts to 39.1. mil. kg (almost 4. kg/capita), and 3100. mil. Czech Crowns (CZK), in the total CR. This value corresponds to 1/6 of the timber harvest value in an average year. Nevertheless, (in recent years) the share is even higher, exceeding 20% of the timber harvest value. A comparatively small part of the population collect NTFP to save money and an even lower share sell NTFP. The data obtained in these studies aims to improve the quality of the state forestry policy focused on the optimum use of NTFP, to enhance the income from forests, to support NTFP commercial production and to raise the level of forest conservation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Czech Republic; Non-timber forest products; Socio-economic importance; Trends","forestry policy; land use; nontimber forest product; socioeconomic impact; time series analysis; trend analysis; Czech Republic; Basidiomycota","Sisak, L.; Department of Forestry Economics and Management, Kamýcká 129, Czech Republic",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84945943037

The objective of this monitoring is to determine if the NWFP is providing for conservation and management of northern spotted owl (NSO) habitat as anticipated. This report focused on the amount, distribution, and spatial arrangement of NSO habitats across the NWFP area; and how these have changed as a result of disturbance and ingrowth starting with the year of the NWFP analyses in 1993. Results showed a net decrease from 9,089,700 ac to 8,954,000 ac (-1.5 percent) of nesting/roosting habitat on NWFP federal lands. This occurred despite gross losses from wildfire of 5.2 percent (474,300 ac), 1.3 percent from timber harvest (116,100 ac), and 0.7 percent from insects or other causes (59,800 ac), indicating that processes of forest succession have compensated for some of the losses resulting from disturbance. Dispersal habitat on NWFP federal lands increased by 2.2 percent (net change), but dispersal-capable landscapes experienced a 5 percent net decrease owing to habitat losses on the surrounding nonfederal lands. Large wildfires continue to be the leading cause for loss of NSO habitat on federal lands. Most of these losses occurred within the network of large reserves designed for NSO conservation. © 2016, USDA Forest Service.

Effective management through sustainable harvesting and market driven commercialization are two contrasting aspects that are bringing challenges in development of NTFPs sector. Identifying potential species having market value, conducting value chain analyses, and sustainable management of NTFPs need analysis of their use patterns by communities and trends at a regional scale. We analyzed use patterns, trends, and challenges in traditional use and management of NTFPs in the southern slope of Kangchenjunga Landscape, Eastern Himalaya and discussed potential implications for conservation and livelihoods. A total of 739 species of NTFPs used by the local people of Kangchenjunga Landscape were reported in the reviewed literature. Of these, the highest number of NTFPs was documented from India (377 species), followed by Nepal (363) and Bhutan (245). Though the reported species were used for 24 different purposes, medicinal and edible plants were the most frequently used NTFP categories in the landscape. Medicinal plants were used in 27 major ailment categories, with the highest number of species being used for gastro-intestinal disorders. Though the Kangchenjunga Landscape harbors many potential NTFPs, trade of NTFPs was found to be nominal indicating lack of commercialization due to limited market information. We found that the unsustainable harvesting and lack of marketing were the major constraints for sustainable management of NTFPs sector in the landscape despite of promising policy provisions. We suggest sustainable harvesting practices, value addition at local level, and marketing for promotion of NTFPs in the Kangchenjunga Landscape for income generation and livelihood improvement that subsequently contributes to conservation. © 2016 Uprety et al.","Medicinal plants; NTFP policy; Potential species; Sustainable use and management; Trade; Traditional knowledge","ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; human; medicinal plant; Nepal; phytotherapy; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Nepal; Phytotherapy; Plants, Medicinal","Uprety, Y.; Research Centre for Applied Science and Technology, Nepal; email: yadavuprety@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17464269,,,"27142597","English","J.

However, information on the economic value for NTFPs for subsistence use and trade under the changing climate is inadequate, particularly in households around Iyondo Forest Reserve (IFR), in Kilombero District, Tanzania. The study identified and quantified NTFPs used for subsistence and trade, estimated its economic value, and examined factors influencing supply of NTFPs at household level. Data were collected through Focus Group Discussions, key informant interviews, questionnaire survey of 208 sample households, and spot market analysis to randomly selected NTFPs collectors, sellers, and buyers. The study identified 12 NTFPs used for subsistence and trade, which was evaluated in terms of the mean annual value per household. The mean annual value of the identified NTFPs ranged from TZS 4700 to 886 600. The estimated economic value of the studied NTFPs was TZS 51.4 billion (USD 36 million). The supply of NTFPs at household level was influenced by distance to the forest, change in forest management regime, seasonality, and change in rainfall pattern.

We analyze the evolution of several parameters, including distance from NTFP harvest site to road, proportion of dietary intake and villagers' incomes. The research is based on field surveys, participatory mapping and the geolocation of activities in three study sites representing different stages along the Mather's forest transition curve: (i) intact forest; (ii) partially degraded forest; and (iii) small areas of degraded forest with plantations of useful trees. The results show that the maximum distance from harvest site to road is higher in Site 2 compared to Site 1 as a consequence of a lower availability of NTFPs; and that this distance is significantly lower in Site 3 due to a drastically smaller village territory. The diversity of bushmeat decreases as game evolves from large to small species, commensurate with the progression of forest transition. As a consequence, there is also a reduction in the proportion of these products represented both in household dietary intake and cash income. This analysis establishes a strong link between the Mather's forest transition curve and a decline in the importance of NTFPs in village production and livelihoods. © 2016 by the authors.","Cameroon and gabon; Forest transition curve; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Socio-ecological systems","Curves (road); Deforestation; Harvesting; Nutrition; Roads and streets; Rural areas; Timber; Cameroon; Degraded forests; Dietary intakes; Different stages; Forest transition; Maximum distance; Non-timber forest products; Socio-ecological systems; Forestry","Gillet, P.; Management of Forest Resources, Passage des Déportés 2, Belgium; email: pgillet@ulg.ac.be",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971254309

NTFPs cannot be measured by monetary estimations alone, as they have significant subsistence and sociocultural importance and are commonly one part of multifaceted, adaptive livelihood strategies. In spite of low-cost substitutes, both rural and urban people continue to use select forest resources for medicine, crafts, rituals, and food. And as drought, disease, famine, and conflict escalate globally, growing numbers of displaced and marginalized people depend upon forest resources for survival. In general, forests managed for timber and NTFPs retain more biodiversity and resilience than forest plantations or forests managed for industrial timber. Forests that harbor NTFPs also protect ecosystem services such as hydrological functions and soil retention and act as a buffer against climate variability. Land use change through logging, fire, and agribusiness is contributing to the degradation of forests, resulting in declining access to NTFPs for local communities. Land stewards can mitigate detrimental impacts to NTFPs by employing multiple-use management practices that emphasize ecosystem services and community needs in addition to traditional forestry outputs (timber and non-timber). For multiple-use forestry to be applied broadly, forest policies need to be cross-sectoral and scale sensitive to lessen regulatory obstacles for small holders and for common pool/property systems. In addition, forestry training needs to include a stronger social focus and improved understanding of the ecology, use, and societal and ecosystem service values of NTFPs. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.","Economic botany; Forest management; Forest policy; Forest value; Non-timber forest products; Rural livelihoods; Subsistence",,"Shanley, P.; Woods and Wayside InternationalUnited States; email: pshanley@woods-wayside.org",,"Springer Berlin Heidelberg",,9783642546013; 9783642546006,,,"English","Tropical Forestry Handb., Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017621060

As a global response to stem further tropical forest degradation, there was the valorization of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) as a viable means of enhancing the lives of the burgeoning forest-adjacent communities by the international community. This paper examines the contribution of NTFPs exploitation to poverty alleviation in the Fako-Meme Forest region as well as the nexus between NTFPs exploitation and forest conservation. This has been based on the consultation of secondary data relating to the types, quantities and incomes derived from NTFPs as a replacement of timber exploitation. These have been supported by primary data obtained from field surveys involving interviews and observations. Findings of the study show that forest dependent communities are significantly involved in the exploitation and commercialization of NTFPs. This is more so because of a wider market which ensued with regional integration in the Central African sub-region alongside neighbouring Nigeria due to improvements in transportation and their proximity to Cameroon. However, the exploitation of these NTFPs is done largely in unsustainable basis thus equally contributing to further forest degradation. This is accounted for by the extensive market and the continuous growth in the populations of these areas as they must excessively exploit NFTPs in order to survive. This therefore calls to question, the introduction and valorization of NTFPs exploitation as an alternative source of livelihood in optimizing forest conservation as opposed to timber exploitation which was identified as a major determinant of forest degradation. Overall, the exploitation of NTFPs slows down forest degradation when compared to timber exploitation. However, as long as these populations keep growing, NTFPs will continue to be incapable of sustainably alleviating poverty. In recognition of this scenario, this study, while recommending the need to control the human population in the long run, in the meantime, it is necessary for all actors to revisit their poverty alleviating strategies in these communities which are centred on the exploitation of NTFPs. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Forest conservation; Meme divisions of Cameroon; NTFPs",,"Emmanuel Sunjo, T.; Department of Geography, Cameroon; email: tataemmanuel@ymail.com",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781536101553; 9781536101393,,,"English","National Parks: Biodivers., Management and Environmental Issues",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030213292

Being located in the confluence of Indo-Malayan, Indo-Chinese, and Indian biogeographic subregions, the region has rich floral and faunal diversity, which is paralleled by high ethnic diversity of over 200 distinct ethnic groups. A large number of communities in this region are traditionally dependent on forest products, especially non-timber forest products (NTFPs), which play a significant role in the maintenance of subsistence and provision of food security to these communities. The study reveals that as much as 94% of the population is dependent on the forest for subsistence in some parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Similarly, 60-90% of the tribal population in states like Nagaland, Manipur, and Tripura is dependent for various purposes on forest resources. Even in the other parts of Northeast India, the level of dependence on forest products is considerable.

The manual removal of this weed (mechanical method) before flowering is the effective means to mitigate the spread of the species in comparison to the biological (Pareuchaetes pseudoinsulata, P. insulata, Actinote thalia-pyrrha) and chemical (Glyphosate, Triclopyrester) methods attempted. It is not trouble in its native habitat but is weedy in India for want of natural enemies to keep it under control. It is a mandate to prevent the loss of native biodiversity due to biological invasions. Conversely, there is an urgent need to devise action plans by managers of the respective wildlife sanctuaries to control and eradicate it. The local people are to be educated of its potential dangers to their farming on one hand and NTFP extraction from the local forests on the other.

Therefore, it is important to improve knowledge on its density, current and future spatial distribution. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the tree density, the climate change effects on the spatial distribution of the species in the future for better conservation. The modeling of the current and future geographical distribution of the species was based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) using a total of 286 occurrence points from field work and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility GBIF-Data Portal. Two climatic models (HadGEM2-ES and Csiro-mk3-6-0) were used under two scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for the projection of the species distribution at the horizon 2050. Correlation analyses and Jackknife test helped to identify seven variables which are less correlated (r < 0.80) with highest contribution to the model. Soil, annual precipitation and temperature (diurnal average Deviation) are the variables which have mostly contributed to the models. Currently, 53% of national territory of Benin, spread from north to south is very suitable for P. biglobosa. At the temporal horizon 2050, the scenarios have projected loss of habitats, which are currently very suitable for P. biglobosa. 51% and 57% are the highest proportions of this habitat lost, which has been registered with HadGEM2-ES model under two scenarios. In order to limit damages such as decreased in productivity and extirpation, some appropriate solutions must be found. It is important to plan the introduction of Parkia biglobosa in reforestation programs and the protection of its potential habitat at national level by the forestry administration which is an asset for a better conservation of this significant NTFP.","Benin; Climate change; Locust bean; MAXENT; Scenario RCP",,"Dotchamou, F.T.; Laboratory of Study and Research in Applied Statistics and Biometrics, Benin; email: adotchamou@yahoo.fr",,"Istituto agronomico per l'Oltremare",22402802,,,,"English","J.

However, it is largely unknown whether this practice meets local economic needs. In Mexico, orchids are one of the most widely traded NTFP in local markets, but studies generally only provide lists of the species for sale. We obtained data for orchid richness and abundance from 56 sellers in a Mexican local market over one year. We related sellers’ economic status to certain socioeconomic variables and determined possible relationships between orchid prices and abundance. Thirty-seven orchid species were recorded; an estimated 18,740 units were offered for sale, most of them harvested in surrounding forests. The greatest abundance of orchids for sale was recorded in October–December, whereas the greatest richness was found in March–April. The ages of the sellers ranged from 14–70 years, 78.5% were women, 50% had either no formal schooling or did not finish elementary school, and 54% spoke an indigenous language. The orchid trade was not the sellers’ main economic activity: to supplement their incomes they traded either agricultural products or other NTFP. Age and speaking an indigenous language were correlated positively with seller poverty and negatively with income obtained in a single sale day. Orchid price had a low, negative relationship with abundance in the market. Mexican law punishes the illegal wildlife trade, but this practice is allowed (at least) at the local level because orchid extraction and trade is a traditional use and custom in the local indigenous community. © 2015, The New York Botanical Garden.","Ethnobotany; indigenous people; non-timber forest products; poverty alleviation; useful plants; wild plants trade",,"Solano-Gomez, R.; Centro Interdisciplinario de Investigacion para el Desarrollo Integral Regional Unidad Oaxaca, Hornos 1003, Santa Cruz Xoxocotlán, Mexico; email: solanogo@yahoo.com.mx",,"Springer New York LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

The Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC) recognises the importance of NTFPs in alleviating poverty and conserving biodiversity and has proposed directives to aid member states to implement appropriate regulations. Data on the regulations governing the chain and its impacts were collected from literature, 12 small and medium enterprises trading an NTFP known as okok (Gnetum spp.) from the production forests to the port of export in Cameroon, and workshops. Laws were bureaucratically, arbitrarily and weakly implemented and enforced. Of 18,368 financial transactions recorded, 81% were bribes, comprising 34% of trader's costs. Corruption in the permit system further creates high transaction costs, negative environmental impacts due to illegal and over-exploitation, and reduces government revenues. The regulatory framework does not promote an enabling business environment. Improvements in governance are imperative if the economic impact upon the livelihoods of thousands of people in the chain is to be maintained and enhanced to ensure sustainable trade. Recommendations to improve the sector in Cameroon include revisions in the regulatory framework and its implementation to increase transparency and counter corruption. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Corruption; Governance; Legality; Livelihoods; Non-timber forest products; Value chains","Biodiversity; Chains; Commerce; Crime; Environmental impact; Timber; Corruption; Governance; Legality; Livelihoods; Non-timber forest products; Value chains; Forestry","Ingram, V.; Sustainable Markets and Chains, PO Box 29703, New Zealand; email: verina.ingram@wur.nl",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Regional development platforms such as the Greater Mekong Subregion, state-propelled market integration and reforestation programs, and lowland entrepreneurs and migrants are all impacting this frontier landscape. Drawing on a mixed methods approach using remote sensing data from 2000 to 2009 and ethnographic fieldwork, we examine how land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) has occurred across three borderland provinces-Lai Châu, Lào Cai and Hà Giang-with high proportions of ethnic minority semi-subsistence farmers. After a broad examination of regional land-use changes, we select three case studies to further analyze the underlying relationships between specific LULCC and local livelihood diversification strategies. These include specific patterns of urban growth due to a range of political decisions in Lai Châu and Lào Cai Provinces; reforestation due to nontimber forest (NTFP) product cultivation in the west of Lào Cai Province; and a stable landscape that restricts government attempts at refashioning upland livelihoods in the east of Hà Giang. Our findings point to the difficulties of completing LULCC maps for this highly heterogeneous region and the complexity of LULCC and livelihood interactions and relationships examined on the ground. © 2015 by the authors.","Cardamom; Ethnic minorities; Land-use and land-cover change; Livelihood diversification; Mixed methods; Northern Vietnam; Reforestation; Urbanization",,"Turner, S.; Department of Geography, 805 rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Canada; email: sarah.turner@mcgill.ca",,"MDPI AG",2073445X,,,,"English","Land",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020101886

The response of plant populations to anthropogenic factors can be assessed on plant demography at landscape level and used for decision-making in conservation and management strategies. We evaluated the influence of anthropogenic and ecological variables on the demography of the tree Caryocar brasiliense, the most harvested fruit species of the Brazilian Cerrado. For this, we assessed how size class distribution and density of plant life-stages of 34 populations were associated with land use and management over a large geographical area. Our results indicate that land use and management affects Caryocar demography. Most population size class distributions significantly fitted to reverse J-shaped curve, indicating good recruitment, and low fit populations were generally subjected to intense cattle ranching. Cattle ranching was also negatively associated with seedling and sapling densities and vegetation thinning with seedling, juvenile and adult densities. Current fruit harvesting levels are not affecting recruitment at the landscape level. We conclude that the negative effect of cattle and vegetation thinning can be mitigated by increasing the rotation time between areas and intervals between thinning events and that current fruit harvesting pressure on Caryocar populations is sustainable across landscape. The social and economic importance of this species is an ecological asset that can be used for the development of public policies promoting multiple uses of habitat remnants to ensure that the strategy of conservation under use is carried out. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Caryocar brasiliense; Cattle grazing; Fruit harvest; Non-timber forest product; Pequi; Vegetation thinning","cerrado; decision making; demography; edible species; fruit; habitat conservation; human activity; land use planning; nontimber forest product; population size; ranching; recruitment (population dynamics); size distribution; thinning; tree; Brazil; Bos; Caryocar; Caryocar brasiliense","Scariot, A.; Embrapa Recursos Genéticos e Biotecnologia, Laboratório de Ecologia e Conservação, Caixa Postal 02372, Brazil",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

We estimated a series of forest value metrics including components of biodiversity, carbon stocks, and timber and non-timber forest product resources, along the recently paved Inter-Oceanic Highway (IOH) integrating Brazil and Peru along the Bolivian border. We installed 69 vegetation plots in intact terra firme forests representative of local community holdings near and far from the IOH, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot.We observed strong geographic gradients in forest value components across the region, with increases from west to east in aboveground biomass and in the abundance of timber and non-timber forest product trees and regeneration. Plots in communities in Pando, Bolivia, where the IOH remains in part unpaved, had the highest aboveground biomass, standing timber volumes and Brazil nut tree density. In contrast, communities in Madre de Dios, Peru, where settlements and unpaved portions of the IOH have existed for decades, and in Acre, Brazil, where paving of the IOH has been underway for more than a decade, were more degraded. Seven of the fifteen forest value components we measured increased with increasing distance from the IOH, although the magnitude of these effects was weak. Landscape scale remote sensing analyses showed much stronger effects of road proximity on deforestation. We suggest that remote sensing techniques including canopy spectral signatures might be calibrated to characterize multiple components of forest value, so that we can estimate landscape scale impacts of infrastructure developments on both deforestation and forest degradation in tropical regions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Açai; Biodiversity; Brazil nut; Carbon stocks; Connectivity; Infrastructure; Livelihood; NTFP; REDD; Road impact; Rubber; Timber; Tropical rainforest","aboveground biomass; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; connectivity; deforestation; infrastructural development; landscape change; rainforest; regeneration; remote sensing; road construction; rubber; spectral analysis; timber; tropical forest; Acre [Brazil]; Amazonia; Bolivia; Brazil; Madre de Dios; Pando; Peru; Bertholletia excelsa","Baraloto, C.; International Center for Tropical Botany, Department of Biological Sciences, Florida International UniversityUnited States",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

A mail survey was conducted to assess the willingness of landowners to engage in alternative forestry enterprises, including pine straw harvesting. Those who owned a relatively large forest area (especially of planted pine), had used a consulting forester, and lived outside of the county where their forestland was located had higher levels of interest in harvesting pine straw for profit. Landowners who resided in the same county as their forestland expected higher prices for their pine straw than absentee owners.

However, little is known about the degree to which widespread but moderate forms of land use that maintain overall vegetation structure are compatible with the conservation of functional diversity. We assessed differences in plant functional composition and functional diversity across savanna woodlands in the Western Ghats, India, managed with varying degrees of biomass extraction, livestock grazing, and ground fire. Across the gradient of moderate land uses, we found shifts in functional composition but no overall decline in functional diversity with land use intensification. Biomass extraction was associated with changes in dispersal mode, reduced seed mass, and lower overstory functional diversity. Livestock grazing was associated with shorter overstory species, reduced seed mass, and increased understory functional diversity. Nonnative invasive species contributed to shifts in understory functional composition with livestock grazing and increased functional diversity with more intensive land use. Our study highlights both the utility and some limitations of assessing conservation value with functional diversity. These results suggest that moderate-intensity local land use can be compatible with maintenance of functional diversity in savanna woodlands of the Western Ghats, and further efforts to maximize this compatibility would benefit conservation in South India's extensive humanmanaged landscapes. However, using functional diversity as the sole metric by which to gauge conservation value can mask threats from invasive species and loss of diversity within categories of biotic dispersal. Therefore, functional diversity metrics are likely to provide a valuable complement to, but not replacement for, other management targets such as species composition. © 2015 by the Ecological Society of America.","Fire; functional dispersion; Functional evenness; Functional traits; Invasive species; Land use intensity; Livestock grazing; Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Savanna woodland; Western Ghats","conservation management; dispersal; fire; functional morphology; grazing; invasive species; land use change; livestock; nontimber forest product; phytomass; savanna; service provision; species diversity; species evenness; vegetation structure; woodland; India; Western Ghats; agriculture; biodiversity; classification; environmental monitoring; human activities; India; introduced species; plant; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Environmental Monitoring; Human Activities; India; Introduced Species; Plants",,,"Ecological Society of America",19395582,,ECAPE,"26552276","English","Ecol.

Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) is one of the world's most economically-important NTFP species extracted almost entirely from natural forests across the Amazon Basin. An obligate outcrosser, Brazil nut flowers are pollinated by large-bodied bees, a process resulting in a hard round fruit that takes up to 14 months to mature. As many smallholders turn to the financial security provided by timber, Brazil nut fruits are increasingly being harvested in logged forests. We tested the influence of tree and stand-level covariates (distance to nearest cut stump and local logging intensity) on total nut production at the individual tree level in five recently logged Brazil nut concessions covering about 4000 ha of forest in Madre de Dios, Peru. Our field team accompanied Brazil nut harvesters during the traditional harvest period (January-April 2012 and January-April 2013) in order to collect data on fruit production. Three hundred and ninety-nine (approximately 80%) of the 499 trees included in this study were at least 100 m from the nearest cut stump, suggesting that concessionaires avoid logging near adult Brazil nut trees. Yet even for those trees on the edge of logging gaps, distance to nearest cut stump and local logging intensity did not have a statistically significant influence on Brazil nut production at the applied logging intensities (typically 1-2 timber trees removed per ha). In one concession where at least 4 trees ha-1 were removed, however, the logging intensity covariate resulted in a marginally significant (0.09) P value, highlighting a potential risk for a drop in nut production at higher intensities. While we do not suggest that logging activities should be completely avoided in Brazil nut rich forests, when a buffer zone cannot be observed, low logging intensities should be implemented. The sustainability of this integrated management system will ultimately depend on a complex series of socioeconomic and ecological interactions. Yet we submit that our study provides an important initial step in understanding the compatibility of timber harvesting with a high value NTFP, potentially allowing for diversification of forest use strategies in Amazonian Perù. © 2015 Rockwell et al.",,"Article; Brazil nut; controlled study; crop production; environmental factor; forest management; geographic distribution; harvest period; harvesting; landscape ecology; logging; nonhuman; risk assessment; risk factor; socioeconomics; Bertholletia; forest; growth, development and aging; Peru; Bertholletia; Forests; Peru",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"26271042","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942880921

We conducted semi-structured interviews, in situ inventories, phytosociological surveys, and analyses of wood quality to identify the set of woody plants used in oil production. Householders use large volumes of dry wood and a set of woody species, which are highly exploited. Additionally, many preferred species have low fuel potential and suffer much use pressure. The best fuelwood species are underused, what requires management strategies to improve their potential as a source of energy.

TDF covers approximately 146,000 km2 (4.4 %) of India, whereas according to the MODIS fire product about 2200 km2 (1.4 %) burns per year. As studies on wildfire effects upon ESs and biodiversity in Indian TDFs are rare we partly transferred findings from other (dry) forest areas to the environmental situation in India. In India (intentionally lit) wildfires have a very important connection to local livelihoods and the availability of non-wood forest products. Very important adverse long-term effects are the deterioration of forest ecosystems and soil degradation. The potential for TDF to regulate hydrological cycles is expected to be greater in the absence of fire than with it. A general judgment on the effect of fire on biodiversity is difficult as it depends on the community and species involved but a loss of biodiversity under regular burnings is apparent. Consequently, forest managers need sound knowledge regarding the interplay of wildfires and ecosystem behavior in general and more specific knowledge regarding the effects on taxa being considered for conservation efforts. Generally, much more research is needed to understand the trade-offs between the short-term benefits gained from forest provisioning services and long-term adverse effects. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; NWFP; Tropical dry forest; Water regulation; Wildfire","Biodiversity; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Fires; Forestry; Tropics; Ecosystem services; NWFP; Tropical dry forest; Water regulation; Wildfire; Ecosystems; soil; biodiversity; disaster; economics; ecosystem; fire; forest; forestry; growth, development and aging; India; organization and management; soil; standards; tree; tropic climate; Biodiversity; Disasters; Ecosystem; Fires; Forestry; Forests; India; Soil; Trees; Tropical Climate","Fiener, P.; Institut für Geographie, Universitätstr. 2, Germany; email: peter.fiener@geo.uni-augsburg.de",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"25900601","English","Environ.

In addition, the presence of a resource-dependent tribal population reaffirms the economic, social and cultural significance of NTFPs. Unsustainable practices and poor co-management and marketing arrangements have rendered the sector ineffective in terms of meeting livelihood as well as conservation goals in the region.

These studies have however, concentrated more on socio-economic issues of NTFPs than methods of inventory. Forest inventory methods developed for timber have been found to be inefficient for NTFPs because of the special characteristics of NTFPs. Efficient inventory methods are essential to provide quality information on the abundance and distribution of the species for sustainable management. This study contributes to methods of NTFP inventory by comparing the efficiency of systematic sampling method with adaptive cluster sampling method for inventorying 3 NTFP species in off- reserve areas of the Goaso forest district, Ghana. Calamus deeratus, raphia palms and bamboo were the 3 NTFP species selected through community and market survey and inventoried in the off-reserve areas of the Goaso forest district. Adaptive cluster sampling with a systematic base was designed to inventory the three species. The results showed that adaptive cluster sampling was about 8 times efficient than systematic sampling for all the 3 species inventoried. However, the density of the species was found to be low and this was attributed to habitat destruction. It was suggested that the methods be tried in a forest reserve where habitat destruction is minimum. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Bih, F.K.; College of Technology Education, P. O.

However, there is a lack of comparative ethnobotanical research on the role of non-wood forest products (NWFPs) as wild food and medicine in local livelihoods in countries with different socio-economic conditions. The aim of this study was to compare the present use of wild food and medicine in three places representing different stages of socio-economic development in Europe. Specifically we explore which plant and fungi species people use for food and medicine in three selected rural regions of Sweden, Ukraine and the Russian Federation. Methods: We studied the current use of NWFPs for food and medicine in three rural areas that represent a gradient in economic development (as indicated by the World Bank), i.e., Småland high plain (south Sweden), Roztochya (western Ukraine), and Kortkeros (Komi Republic in North West Russia). All areas were characterised by (a) predominating rural residency, (b) high forest coverage, and (c) free access to NWFPs. A total of 205 in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with local residents in the three study areas. The collected NWFPs data included (1) the species that are used; (2) the amount harvested, (3) uses and practices (4) changes over time, (5) sources of knowledge regarding the use of NWFPs as wild food and medicine and (6) traditional recipes. Results: In Sweden 11 species of wild plant and fungi species were used as food, and no plant species were used for medicinal purposes. In Ukraine the present use of NWFPs included 26 wild foods and 60 medicinal species, while in Russia 36 food and 44 medicinal species were reported. Conclusions: In the economically less developed rural areas of Ukraine and Russia, the use of NWFPs continues to be an important part of livelihoods, both as a source of income and for domestic use as food and medicine. In Sweden the collection of wild food has become mainly a recreational activity and the use of medicinal plants is no longer prevalent among our respondents. This leads us to suggest that the consumption of wild food and medicine is influenced by the socio-economic situation in a country. © 2015 Stryamets et al.",,"Basidiomycota; Fungi; plant extract; adult; Agaricales; classification; clinical trial; economics; edible plant; ethnobotany; female; food; human; interview; male; medicinal plant; middle aged; multicenter study; phytotherapy; procedures; recreation; rural population; Russian Federation; socioeconomics; Sweden; traditional medicine; Ukraine; young adult; Adult; Agaricales; Ethnobotany; Female; Food; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Medicine, Traditional; Middle Aged; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Plants, Edible; Plants, Medicinal; Recreation; Rural Population; Russia; Socioeconomic Factors; Sweden; Ukraine; Young Adult","Stryamets, N.; Nature reserve Roztochya, Sitchovuh Strilciv 7, Ukraine",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17464269,,,"26077671","English","J.

A growing number of cases highlight commercial trades in wild flora and fauna that have been undocumented in official data. Here we present the first in-depth study of the trade of wild-collected ornamental plants in continental Southeast Asia, focusing on the four largest wildlife markets in Thailand. Botanical surveys revealed a massive, previously undocumented commercial trade in wild, protected ornamental plants involving Thailand, Lao PDR and Myanmar, focusing primarily on the Orchidaceae. The results indicate that illegal trade threatens not only charismatic Southeast Asian mammals, reptiles and amphibians, but also hundreds of tropical plant species. Trade surveys identified 347 orchid species in 93 genera, including many listed as threatened. The observed cross-border trade moves plants at a rate orders of magnitude larger than government-reported statistics, and directly conflicts with official policy statement. Harvester interviews strongly indicated that wild collection was negatively affecting the majority of species they traded. Despite three decades of broad restrictions on the international trade of all wild orchids, these results highlight a major conservation challenge that has been almost completely overlooked. There is urgent need to improve botanical trade monitoring, to operationalize existing conservation commitments, and as part of a broader, multifaceted response to illegal trade. We call for increased attention to botanical trade and conservation in Southeast Asia, and argue that efforts to tackle illegal wildlife trade must ensure they include flora. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Botanical conservation; CITES; Market; NTFP; Orchid; Thailand","endangered species; environmental management; hunting; nature conservation; ornamental species; trade; wildlife management; Laos; Myanmar; Thailand; Amphibia; Mammalia; Orchidaceae; Reptilia","Phelps, J.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Jalan CIFOR, Situ Gede, Indonesia",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

Nevertheless the sustainability of NTFP harvesting has been debated as the nature of NTFPs harvesting regimes scale of commercialization are highly heterogeneous, few studies have evaluated the cumulative ecological economic effects of such regimes. Here we assessed the medium-term (10 years) sustainability of NTFP harvesting using Chamaedorea palm leaves a major NTFP from Mesoamerica that is highly valued in the international floral industry as a case study. We used an experimental ecological study and an economic assessment to analyse the sustainability of leaf harvesting in C. ernesti-augustii. A 4-year leaf removal experiment was conducted to assess effects of increasing levels of defoliation (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% leaf removal, biannually) on palm survivorship, leaf production and leaf quality. Results of this experiment were combined with estimations of harvest economic value to make projections of the availability of leaves and profit per unit area. Finally, we determined harvesting regimes that maximize profit while maintaining medium-term viability of exploited populations. Palms tolerated up to 50% chronic defoliation, but higher defoliation levels reduced survivorship, leaf production and leaf quality. In the long term, this 50% defoliation level maximized harvest volume and profit without significantly affecting palm survival and leaf quality. Our results show that harvesters face the dilemma of either maximizing short-term income leading to rapid exhaustion of stocks, or maintaining exploited populations but maximizing income in the long term. Synthesis and applications. Our study shows that intermediate harvesting levels (≤50% leaf removal) are needed to achieve long-term sustainability of Chamaedorea palm leaves. Results of this study have an immediate application for the amendment of the official Mexican law, which enables higher harvesting intensities of Chamaedorea leaves, and for the design of sustainable management strategies. Applications of such strategies should consider community-based management, fair markets, regulating norms, as well as a thorough communication among stakeholders. © 2014 The Authors.","Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii; Defoliation; Mexico; Plant demography; Socio-ecological sustainability; Tropical rain forest","biodiversity; commercialization; economic analysis; ecosystem service; harvesting; nontimber forest product; profitability; removal experiment; stakeholder; sustainability; Mesoamerica; Chamaedorea; Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii","Hernández-Barrios, J.C.; Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas, Antigua Carretera a Pátzcuaro 8701, Mexico",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00218901,,JAPEA,,"English","J.

We studied abundance and population structure in 34 plots of 20×10m (0.68 ha) of three localities (Plato, Córdoba and Magangué) at the Mompox Depression, an inner delta formed by the confluence of four large rivers. We recorded growth and mortality of 164 palms of different size classes over 13 months, and additionally we estimated seedling and juvenile mortality in two 10x10m plots within the same sites. Data analysis using Kolgomorov-Smirnov (KS), Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were made on Statgraphics Plus and SPSS. We related the structure and dynamics of the palm stands to flood intensity. Copernicia tectorum has the fastest leaf production rate recorded for any palm (19-23 leaves/year in subadults and adults), and a short life span of ca. 46 years. The abundance, density and high leaf production rate of this palm offer a great potential for the sustainable use of its unexpanded leaves (especially at Plato, where there are ca. 480ha of palm stands with 300-1 000 individuals/ha), as leaf harvest from subadult and adult individuals does not appear to affect population structure. The palm is a pioneer of the flood plain, and the palm stands at particular sites appear to wax and wane following sedimentation dynamics, in which the species plays in important role. Current population structure and the scarce recruitment of juveniles at the study site suggest that the population is waning in that site. Management actions should be taken to reestablish natural river dynamics at the lagoon complex where the palm grows. Appropriate management of palm stands may contribute to minimize any negative effects of river dynamics. © 2015, Universidad de Costa Rica.

However, there is also an assumption on the part of policy-makers that any harvesting of wild animal or plant products from the forests and other natural and modified ecosystems must be detrimental to the long-term viability of target populations and species. This book challenges this idea and shows that while examples of such negative impacts certainly exist, there are also many examples of sustainable harvesting systems for NTFPs. The chapters review and present coherent and scientifically sound information and case studies on the ecologically sustainable use of NTFPs. They also outline a general interdisciplinary approach for assessing the sustainability of NTFP harvesting systems at different scales.

Despite this, conservation research on NTFPs typically focuses on harvest alone, ignoring possible confounding effects of other anthropogenic and ecological factors. Disentangling anthropogenic disturbances is critical in regions such as India's Western Ghats, a biodiversity hotspot with high human density. Identifying strategies that permit both use and conservation of resources is essential to preserving biodiversity while meeting local needs. We assessed the effects of NTFP harvesting (fruit harvest from canopy and lopping of branches for fruit) in combination with other common anthropogenic disturbances (cattle grazing, fire frequency and distance from village), in order to identify which stressors have greater effects on recruitment of three tropical dry forest fruit tree species. Specifically, we assessed the structure of 54 populations of Phyllanthus emblica, P. indofischeri and Terminalia chebula spread across the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, Western Ghats to ask: (1) How are populations recruiting? and (2) What anthropogenic disturbance and environmental factors, specifically forest type and elevation, are the most important predictors of recruitment status? We combined participatory research with an information-theoretic model-averaging approach to determine which factors most affect population structure and recruitment status. Our models illustrate that for T. chebula, high fire frequency and high fruit harvest intensity decreased the proportion of saplings, while lopping branches or stems to obtain fruit increased it. For Phyllanthus spp, recruitment was significantly lower in plots with more frequent fire. Indices of recruitment of both species were significantly higher for plots in more open-canopy environments of savanna woodlands than in dry forests. Our research illustrates an approach for identifying which factors are most important in limiting recruitment of NTFP populations and other plant species that may be in decline, in order to design effective management strategies. © 2015 Varghese et al.",,"agricultural management; Article; canopy; controlled study; Emblica officinalis; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental stress; geographic distribution; grazing; harvesting; India; Phyllanthus; Phyllanthus indofischeri; population structure; Terminalia chebula; biodiversity; biological model; fruit; growth, development and aging; human; physiology; Terminalia; tree; Bos; Phyllanthus emblica; Phyllanthus indofischeri; Terminalia chebula; Biodiversity; Fruit; Humans; India; Models, Biological; Terminalia; Trees",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"25781482","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925003310

The new plans were completed under the title: The Western Oregon Plan Revisions. The plan revisions were initiated partially in response to a settlement agreement in a long-standing lawsuit filed by the timber industry and western Oregon counties. The BLM developed the plans with cooperating agencies including representatives from a tribe, counties, state, and other federal agencies. The RMPs used knowledge gained from years of monitoring implementation of the NWFP resulting in a robust array of spatial resource data used to drive science-based analytical models in a ""data-driven"" planning process. Using the Federal Land Policy and Management Act's land-use planning processes and associated National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) analyses to resolve an issue with deep-seated polarized positions is not automatic and can fail without consistent support of political and agency leadership. The current structure of federal laws puts agencies trying to implement their various laws and direction at odds with one another. A clearer understanding of how the various agencies' mandates interact with one another may help with interagency collaboration under the NEPA processes. If land management plans are to be tied to Endangered Species Act recovery plans, both need to be managed as dependent, interrelated efforts. The failure of one affects the other.

NTFPs contribute significantly to forest economy of developed and industrialized nations also. NTFPs can be processed or value added into consumer-oriented products. They have commercial importance and can contribute to the economic development of a region or a nation. Commercialization or value addition of NTFPs is now promoted as an approach to rural development especially in tropical forest areas. Unfortunately, commercialization of NTFPs has exploited and deprived the collectors. The chapter describes the prospects, constraints, and strategies to overcome these constraints of NTFP development and its value addition. The successful NTFP commercialization will be transparent, equitable, and sustainable which will have a positive impact on poverty reduction, gender equality, resource access, tenure, and management which demands aggressive policy interventions. The effective policy interventions can improve the stake of all stakeholders involved in NTFP from collection to value addition and ultimately improve collection, value addition, income, and livelihood without sacrificing the principles of sustainable forest conservation. © Springer India 2015.",,,"Chakravarty, S.; Department of Forestry, India",,"Springer India",,9788132222620; 9788132222613,,,"English","Value Addition of Horticultural Crops: Recent Trends and Future Directions",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957027900

NTFP use frequently raises concerns about the sustainability of, or ecological impacts associated with, NTFP harvesting, as well as local contextual factors which may limit or reduce the impacts. Here we test the conceptual model first advanced by Uma Shaanker et al. (2004) relating to the factors that may limit or exacerbate the ecological impacts associated with NTFP harvesting. These were the extent of local dependence on NTFPs, the degree of marketing and the level of local ecological knowledge. Data were collected via household questionnaires and ecological surveys of woody plants from eight villages throughout South Africa. We found no significant relationships between measures of ecological impact with local ecological knowledge or market proximity and engagement. There was a strong positive relationship between ecological impacts and NTFP dependency as indexed through mean annual direct-use value for NTFPs. This indicates that the higher the dependency and demand for NTFPs, the greater is the possibility of high impacts to the local environment. However, other contextual drivers not included in the original Uma Shaanker et al. (2004) model may also play a role, particularly the strength of local resource governance institutions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Communal; Direct-use value; Governance; Management; Open access; South Africa","Commerce; Developing countries; Forestry; Harvesting; Management; Surveys; Sustainable development; Timber; Communal; Direct-use value; Governance; Open Access; South Africa; Ecology; Forest Management; Forests; Incomes","Shackleton, C.M.; Dept. of Environmental Science, Rhodes UniversitySouth Africa",,"Elsevier",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

Therefore, logging concessionaires, especially when they exploit species having both timber and non-timber values, are often blamed for jeopardizing forest peoples' livelihoods. We have tested this assumption in two logging concessions located in the South and East regions of Cameroon. Contrary to most publications about NTFPs, our case studies (1) focus on actual conflicts and not on potential conflicts of use, (2) favour a holistic approach to the local uses of resources rather than focusing exclusively on NTFPs. Our results show that gathering is mainly destined for home consumption and that its contribution to the monetary income of the households is secondary compared with agricultural commodities, bush meat and timber extraction. However, the perceived importance of gathering by focus groups is much higher than the actual economic contribution to livelihoods obtained through quarterly household surveys. Such discrepancy is probably due to the cultural importance of NTFPs for forest people. The article concludes that NTFP gathering is seldom a source of conflict between concessionaires and communities. Encroachments into concessions for agricultural expansion, massive poaching and illegal logging are the major sources of conflicts, which need to be tackled in priority. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","agricultural development; forest people; household economy; logging concessionaires","agricultural development; commodity market; exploitation; forest management; forest resource; logging (timber); nontimber forest product; resource allocation; Cameroon","Levang, P.; IRD/CIFOR, BP 2008, Cameroon",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14728028,,FTLOA,,"English","For.

The plan established a network of conservation reserves and an ecosystem management strategy on ~10 million hectares from northern California to Washington State, USA, within the range of the federally threatened northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina). Several subsequent assessments-and 20 years of data from monitoring programs established under the plan-have demonstrated the effectiveness of this reserve network and ecosystem management approach in making progress toward attaining many of the plan's conservation and ecosystem management goals. This paper (1) showcases the fundamental conservation biology and ecosystem management principles underpinning the NWFP as a case study for managers interested in large-landscape conservation; and (2) recommends improvements to the plan's strategy in response to unprecedented climate change and land-use threats. Twenty years into plan implementation, however, the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, under pressure for increased timber harvest, are retreating from conservation measures. We believe that federal agencies should instead build on the NWFP to ensure continuing success in the Pacific Northwest. We urge federal land managers to (1) protect all remaining late-successional/old-growth forests; (2) identify climate refugia for at-risk species; (3) maintain or increase stream buffers and landscape connectivity; (4) decommission and repair failing roads to improve water quality; (5) reduce fire risk in fire-prone tree plantations; and (6) prevent logging after fires in areas of high conservation value. In many respects, the NWFP is instructive for managers considering similar large-scale conservation efforts. ï¿½ 2015 by the authors.","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem management; Global forest model; Northern spotted owl; Northwest Forest Plan","Biodiversity; Birds; Climate change; Climate models; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Historic preservation; Information management; Land use; Managers; Timber; Water quality; Ecological integrity; Ecosystem management; Forest modeling; Northern spotted owl; Northwest Forest Plan; Conservation; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem management; forest management; land management; modeling; timber harvesting; water quality; United States; Strix occidentalis caurina","DellaSala, D.A.; Geos Institute, 84-4th Street, United States; email: dominick@geosinstitute.org",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946593155

Identifying the multipurpose character of NWFP is contributed to intensifying their commercial exploitation. The increasing of global demand has enabled the enterprises from Serbia, in accordance with its capabilities, more oriented towards exports of final products of organic food. Fragmented non-standard production in the past, Serbia could not have a significant participation in foreign markets, however, the establishment of different forms of association with the implementation of standards, also including appropriate marketing activities, opportunities for the enterprises to expand significantly. In order to gain insight into the developmental tendencies of local enterprises involved in the purchase, processing and marketing of NWFPs, it has been conducted a survey in order to define trends in their placement. The purpose of this research has been to determine trends in the exports of certain types of raw and value added NWFPs, on the basis of the study samples located in Central Serbia. The goal of this article is to study marketing activities of chosen small and medium enterprises (SMEs) engaged in purchasing, processing and marketing of NWFPs, as well as presenting of current marketing activities of surveyed SMEs and providing of some recommendations for more efficient export in the sector. The main subject of the research is amounts of placed NWFPs in the foreign market. The applied methodology is based on the analysis of time series by trend, which defined the movement in amounts, realized on foreign markets and made projections of exports in the future. The primary method of this study was modelling, while the statistical techniques were used as a method of trend analysis, with the use of regression and correlation analyses. By this study it has been shown the role of efficient market activities in the surveyed enterprises, as one of the important instruments for achieving economic goals. © 2015, Lietuvos Misku Institutas.

However latter is nowadays the only form of agroforestry which is widely practiced in northern parts of Finland as area coverage of wood pastures has declined steeply form the beginning of 1950's. Finland has vast resources of forest, the total forest coverage being 71, 6 % of Finland's total land area. This number is one of the highest in the world. However, new innovative and active agroforestry measures distinctive to the environment and culture has not been developed in the past though forests hold several, readily available Non-wood Forest Products (NWFP's). Forests have mainly been seen as a source of timber and pulp and the awareness of multiple uses of forest has not been come to prominence until 1990's. Berries and mushrooms are Finland's most important NWFPs. They are collected from the wild for incomes and recreation. The yearly value of forest berry- and mushroom harvests varies from 4 to 25 million € and from 300 000 to 4 million €, respectively. Berry- and mushroom harvests vary greatly between years, depending on weather conditions affecting the flowering, pollination and fruiting body formation. As wild berries and mushrooms are the most important NWFP's in Finland, MTT Agrifood Finland (as from 1.1.2015 Natural Resources Institute Finland - Luke) started to develop innovative, active agroforestry methods for high-yielding and constant berry and mushroom production. Two projects were launched; LUSTI in 2010 and RahaRääseikkö in 2012. Both of them were funded by the EU Rural Development Programme for Mainland Finland 2007-2013. Project LUSTI - Securing the Availability of Nature Derived Berries with Cultivation Practices, aimed to test the feasibility of several agroforestry - based cultivation practices to ensure higher and more stable wild berry harvests. Project RahaRääseikkö aimed to develop mushroom production methods in low productive forests. Both of these projects aim to shape new cultural identity for Finnish agroforestry. These projects are presented briefly in this article.","Agroforestry; Berries; Bilberry; Inonotus obliquus; Lingonberry; Mushrooms","Agriculture; Environmental protection; Fruits; Fungi; Harvesting; Regional planning; Agroforestry; Berries; Bilberry; Inonotus obliquus; Lingonberry; Mushrooms; Forestry","Vanhanen, H.; Natural Resources Institute Finland - Luke, Yliopistonkatu 6, Finland; email: henri.vanhanen@luke.fi","Pernicova D.Fialova J.","Mendel University in Brno",,9788075092519,,,"English","Public Recreat.

A Sustainable Livelihoods Framework is applied to estimate rural livelihood assets associated with differences in climate conditions, such as the 2010 normal climate and the 2011 climate event, and to compare household strategies in each climate condition. The findings indicate that natural capital had the highest index value in the 2010 normal climate, whereas human capital had the highest value in the 2011 climate event. Financial capital had the lowest index in both climate conditions. Residents at the research site were better off in terms of natural capital but worse off in terms of financial capital. This indicates that the government and other rural development agencies should not only manage natural resources; income-generation activities are also needed. We conclude that natural resources, as well as non-timber forest product (NTFP) gathering and off-farm activity, were the most important strategies for the entire research site under the normal climate condition. NTFP gathering and outside work are important in meeting subsistence needs and augmenting income levels in households when the rainy season begins early as a result of climate change. Outside employment was an additional strategy in households to achieve their livelihood goals, including food security and household income generation, under conditions of economic change and climate events. © 2015 The Association of Japanese Geographers","Climate change; Early onset of rainy season; Household assets; Livelihood vulnerability; Swidden cultivation",,"Ingxay, P.; Department of Geography, Japan; email: phanxay_@hotmail.com",,"Association of Japanese Geographers",13479555,,,,"English","Geogr.

The situation is getting especially critical for communities solely dependent on common property resources (CPRs) associated with marginal lands, leading to major problems of impoverishment. The present study was carried out in a cluster of three villages in Deori taluka (administrative unit) of Gondia district of Maharashtra state, India, listed as a backward district by Planning Commission of India. Livelihood in these villages is characterized by their dependence on declining non-timber forest produce (NTFP), shrinking CPRs, low agricultural productivity, lack of soil and water conservation measures, low productivity of livestock, high rate of migration, and lack of infrastructure and credit institutions. Based on information obtained through a baseline survey, participatory land use plan (PLUP) aimed at improved management of available resources for sustainable tribal livelihood and conserve forests was formulated and implemented. Interventions like optimal rainwater management thorough community action, pisciculture, and diversified cropping were introduced. Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of NTFP was done. As a result of scientific interventions, significant improvement in land productivity and consequently economic development was noted. Two years of implementation of the plan has indicated that sustainable land use plan could not be implemented effectively without mobilization of a proactive community. The ideal way to ensure a proactive participation is to create an impact by starting with interventions where economic benefits are quickly realized and their potentials could be easily perceptible. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Common property resources; Land use planning; Resource management; Sustainable livelihood; Tribal","baseline survey; common property resource; land use planning; quantitative analysis; resource development; resource management; sustainability; Gondia; India; Maharashtra","Patil, N.G.; National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, Amravati Road, India",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922319281

Collection (and purchase) of tree NTFPs was widespread, especially of firewood and fruits. The ratio collected from homesteads relative to other urban spaces differed between products and the amount required. Overall, approximately 20% of household income was derived from urban tree NTFPs. The highest contribution (33%) was amongst the poorest sectors represented by mostly recent migrants to towns who were living in informal settlements whilst trying to establish a foothold in the urban economy.

Yet overharvesting can still influence the regeneration and sustainability of these resources. Developing sustainable harvesting practices for emerging NTFPs depends on the biology of the NTFP species, the ecological context in which management occurs, and its cost in terms of effort and resources. Allanblackia stuhlmannii (Clusiaceae) is a canopy tree species whose seeds are a source of vegetable oil and an important food for rodents. In an experiment within the Amani Nature Reserve (Tanzania), we studied how enrichment planting of A. stuhlmannii seeds affected germination and establishment rates under varying local levels of seed abundance and rodent activity. Overall, germination and establishment rates were high (4.8% and 2.2%, respectively, after 11 months), while local ecological conditions had a short lived (1-2 weeks) and unexpectedly small influence on the persistence of planted seeds. Given these rates, we estimate a cost of approximately US$0.14 per seedling. Enrichment planting of seeds, across a range of local ecological conditions, appears to be a viable and cost effective management strategy for increasing A. stuhlmannii recruitment in harvested areas. © 2015 The Authors.","Cricetomys; East Usambara Mountains; Eastern Arc Mountains; Germination; Recruitment; Seed fate","Clusiaceae; Cricetomys; Rodentia","Seltzer, C.E.; National Geographic Society, 1145 17th St NW, United States",,"Elsevier",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

The shea fruit is a non-timber forest product (NTFP) that is indigenous to ecosystems in semi-arid regions of Africa. Current methods and equipment for processing shea kernel into butter impose a dilemma of excessive harvesting of fuel wood for heating and the use of large quantities of water. Thus, the nature of input requirement and production process presents implications for conflict over natural resource use and for sustainability as more processing takes place. Material flow analysis was applied to the data generated from the processing experiments. The outcome was discussed in focus group discussion sessions and individual interviews as a way of data triangulation to validate study parameters. Results from this experiment showed that the quantity of water used in urban processing sites was higher than that used in rural sites.

Moreover, these phenomena raise the demand for food, fuel, wood fibers and other non-wood products, contributing to a further boost of the production pressure in the surviving forests. Simultaneously, these forests are expected to provide a diverse array of environmental services. Furthermore, smallholder forestry systems are prominent components of 'trees outside the forest' in Southeast Asia and they are primarily 'planted' systems that rehabilitate or reforest marginal lands, in order to produce tree products and services. As they traditionally are a means of producing goods for home consumption, they have become significant suppliers of products for local, national and international markets. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that smallholder forestry systems are a viable management system which is significantly contributing to global environmental goals and local economic objectives. This paper reviews global and Asian trends of human population growth, deforestation, and demand for forest and tree products. The origin, the diversity, the adaptable management and the importance of smallholder tree-based systems are here discussed and significant details are provided on the role of smallholder tree-based systems in the mitigation of deforestation, which could be obtained by expanding regional forest resources; in supplying alternative sources of forest products and environmental benefits; and in making significant contributions to local livelihoods for rural communities.","Environmental benefits; Livelihood enhancement; NTFPs; Smallholder; Timber; Tree-farming",,"Roshetko, J.M.; World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF), Indonesia; email: J.Roshetko@cgiar.org",,"Centro di Ricerca per la Selvicoltura, Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e l'Analisi dell'Economia Agraria",2284354X,,,,"English","Ann.

However, the recent conversion from extraction of hearts of palm to berries harvesting for pulp production, a nondestructive use, had a remarkable effect on species conservation and its potential for cash provision and forest landscape restoration. Pulp production from E. edulis in the Atlantic Forest is strongly benefiting from the traditional and expanding market of açaí pulp produced from Euterpe oleraceae in the Amazon Basin. In this article, we assess the current status of this new NTFP from E. edulis in the State of Santa Catarina, tracing a parallel with the açaí production chain in the Amazon. In addition to a literature review, we surveyed the production chain and interviewed key stakeholders. Production of juçara pulp soared from 5 tons in 2010 to 97.76 tons in 2011, but production is clearly far from fulfilling the fast growing demand. With 115 fruit collectors, management in backyard agroforestry represents 80% of production, with the secondary forests providing the remainder. Two types of producers in Santa Catarina—industrial and family farmers—are distinguished by their form of processing, production scale and sales. Familiarity of farmers with juçara palm as well as the better infrastructure of the region compared to the Amazon gives juçara pulp good condition for the development of the production chain. Nonetheless, it is clearly important to define strategies under public and private policies for research, development, and dissemination of sustainable production models, based on the ecology of the species, landscape structure, and sociocultural values.

This limits our ability to understand the drivers of these dynamics and effectively manage plant populations in the face of changing disturbance regimes. Fire, grazing and harvest of wild plants are three widespread, commonly co-occurring land management activities in the tropics that contribute to altered disturbance regimes. In this study, we investigate the effects of and interactions among these activities on mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi) populations in the Western Ghats, India with data from 14 palm populations, including over 2300 palm ramets monitored from 2009 to 2011. We construct integral projection models (IPMs) of palm population dynamics based on the response of palm individuals to fire and varying intensities of grazing and leaf harvest and carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to understand the implications of different scenarios of disturbance for population persistence. We find that palm individuals and populations were resilient to low levels of fire, grazing and harvest. There are also important interactions among these forms of disturbance: intensities of harvest and grazing are highest in populations one to two years after fire, and the intensity of harvest is lower in heavily grazed populations. These interactions mean that the combined effects of multiple forms of disturbance differ from what would be assumed from simply adding their separate effects. While simulations show that sustained high intensities of harvest and grazing would have severely negative consequences for palm populations, interactions between these two forms of disturbance prevent palm populations from actually experiencing such extreme conditions. On the other hand, because intensities of grazing and harvest both increase moderately following fire, their combined negative effects on population growth rates are exacerbated by fire. Thus, multiple, interacting disturbances determine the resilience of these palm populations and the sustainability of their management. Synthesis. This study illustrates the importance of explicitly incorporating realistic interactions among multiple forms of disturbance when evaluating plant populations' resilience to changing disturbance regimes and the sustainability of plant harvest. We construct integral projection models of mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi) population dynamics to understand the implications of varying fire return intervals and intensities of grazing and leaf harvest for population persistence.

We analysed the amounts of edible fruit, seeds and flowers produced per hectare of cardonal, jiotillal and tetechera forests, their economic value and actual extraction rates, hypothesizing that the economic benefits of these NTFP would potentially be comparable to maize agriculture, which involves forest removal. Methods: Our study comprised the whole territory of the community of Quiotepec, Oaxaca. Sustainable gathering rates were analysed through population dynamics models and simulations of harvesting regimes (10%, 25%, and 50% of fruit gathered) per hectare of forest type. We used estimations on economic benefit and ecological impact of these scenarios to evaluate their relative sustainability, compared with maize agroforestry systems harbouring 2-47% of vegetation cover. Results: For the whole territory, the total annual fruit production is 509.3 ton of Pachycereus weberi, 267.4 ton of Neobuxbaumia tetetzo, 99.5 ton of Escontria chiotilla, and 8.1 ton of Myrtillocactus geometrizans. The total economic value of fruits per hectare was $315.00 U.S. dollars for cardonal, $244.60 for jiotillal, and $113.80 for tetechera, whereas rainfed agriculture of maize was on average $945.52. Demographic models for E. chiotilla and N. tetetzo indicate that 70% and 95% of fruit harvesting, respectively maintain λ > 1, but these harvest rates cannot be recommendable since themodels do not consider the high inter-annual environmental variations and the non-estimated amount of fruit consumed by natural frugivorous. Extracting 25% of fruit is ecologically more sustainable, but with low economic benefits. Agroforestry systems maintaining the higher vegetation cover provide economic benefits from agriculture and forest resources. Conclusions: Combining forest extraction and agroforestry systems are ideal scenarios to sustainable fruit harvest programmes. In addition, fair commerce of transformed products would substantially favour goals of sustainable management. © 2014 Pérez-Negrón et al.","Arid zones forests; Columnar cacti; Non-timber forest products; Pitaya; Sustainable harvest","Cactaceae; Escontria chiotilla; Myrtillocactus geometrizans; Neobuxbaumia tetetzo; Pachycereus weberi; Stenocereus stellatus; Zea mays; Cactaceae; economics; ecosystem; environmental protection; ethnobotany; forest; fruit; Mexico; Cactaceae; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Ethnobotany; Forests; Fruit; Mexico","Casas, A.; Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas, UNAM, Campus Morelia, Postal 27-3 Santa Maria de Guido Morelia, Mexico",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17464269,,,"25539885","English","J.

We created a bioeconomic model to investigate the socioeconomic conditions favoring cultivation over wild harvesting and likely impacts on the wild population. We parameterize the model with the case study of illegal xaté palm (Chamaedorea ernestiaugusti) harvesting in Belize and Guatemala. We examine how changes in law enforcement, a price premium for cultivated leaf, land ownership, and alternative income might affect decisions to cultivate and the impact of cultivation on wild populations. We show that those switching to cultivation are largely not wild harvesters because of barriers such as land ownership. We also find that if harvesters do switch to cultivation, they may have a negative effect on the wild population through harvesting of material to set up plantations. We found increasing alternative income reduces harvesting pressure and suggests the provision of alternative livelihoods would more directly reduce pressure on the wild population. Although schemes to encourage cultivation seem an appealing conservation intervention, we urge caution in assuming that people will readily adopt cultivation of wild harvested species or that this would necessarily reduce impacts on wild populations. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America","Agent-based model; Conservation; Harvesting; NTFP; Socioeconomics; Xaté","captive breeding; cultivation; environmental policy; harvesting; plant community; socioeconomic conditions; wild population; Belize [Central America]; Guatemala [Central America]; agriculture; Arecaceae; Belize; biological model; computer simulation; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; Guatemala; physiology; population dynamics; procedures; Agriculture; Arecaceae; Belize; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Guatemala; Models, Biological; Population Dynamics",,,"Ecological Society of America",19395582,,ECAPE,"29188688","English","Ecol.

No-where has this diversity been greater than in tropical South Asia, and in particular south India and Sri Lanka. As economies advance towards full development and populations become increasingly urbanized, forests become increasingly valued for their services. National development generally occurs at differing rates in different regions, with rural forest dependent communities falling behind and pockets of poverty long remaining. The demand for 'non-timber forest products' (NTFPs) therefore changes from subsistence to monetary based values. Overall, though, forests have suffered an unprecedented decline with development in the tropics, especially in Asia. This necessitates restoration which takes account of the enrichment of economy, wellbeing and culture which forest products provide. Methods for such restoration, and the fundamental principles upon which these must rest, are presented for species yielding NTFP's. In this paper we first review the history of NTFP species use within south India and Sri Lanka. Second we provide a description of the broad regional characterizations of the forest formations within this region in relation to their affiliated patterns of NTFP use and exploitation. We consider seven guilds as a way to categorize NTFP's into autecological groups for application in restoration silviculture, and use it as a framework to suggest restoration protocols for South Asian forests. We use examples of scenarios based on experimental studies of NTFP's in reforestation trials which take account of different social values and land tenures.

Ciung Wanara, No. 1X, South Denpasar, 80225, Indonesia","In the wet forest regions of southwest Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats, India, Pinus caribaea was a common tree species for reforestation on public lands that were originally cleared of native forest for agriculture but subsequently succeeded to fire tolerant grasses and ferns. Much of this reforestation occurred during the 1970s and 1980s. The ecological literature suggests that in many temperate broadleaf forest regions pine is an important component of early succession on old fields, beneath which second growth hardwood can establish and eventually dominate. More recent studies have demonstrated the establishment of native rain forest regeneration beneath a variety of exotic tree plantations. We review nearly twenty-five years of research on this topic for South Asia through a series of studies done in southwest Sri Lanka. Results demonstrate that native species recruitment of both pioneers and site generalist late-successional trees grow well beneath exotic pine plantations. Diversity and density increase from plantation interior to edge. Protection from groundstory fire is the single most important component of promoting regeneration recruitment beneath pine. Establishing late-successional site and dispersal restricted species requires planting beneath pine rather than reliance on natural establishment. Best establishment and growth occur in openings where rows of canopy pine have been removed. Species considered for planting comprise the major late-successional canopy tree species of the forest in the genera Dipterocarpus, Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) and Mesua (Clusiaceae). Native species that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) need to be planted with best results in canopy openings. The most valuable NTFP's comprise a sugar palm (Caryota urens), rattan (Calamus spp.) and a medicinal liana (Coscinium fenestratum).

Collecting NTFPs is a livelihood option for lakhs of poor households that live on the fringes of these forests, aspect that was well illustrated in the case of Natham, Kanakapura and Mudumalai in the preceding chapters (Chaps. 2 , 3 and 4 ). As a result of this dependence, it is likely that unsustainable harvesting practices emerge resulting in the loss of natural stock (Murthy et al. 2008 ), loss of in situ diversity and consequent undermining of the livelihoods of these communities. Therefore, the management of NTFPs needs policy solutions in order to sustain these resources for both biodiversity and livelihood.

Interventions to encourage growth of NTFP markets, however, often succeed at reaching only subsets of target populations. To address impacts of changing NTFP markets on livelihoods and sustainable forest management, value chain and livelihood systems analyses were used to evaluate impacts of a buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) handicraft market on heterogeneous buriti users in Maranhão, Brazil. Data were obtained through interviews with 97 individuals who operated as different types of buriti users. Buriti value chain diagrams were constructed by identifying patterns among responses. Socioeconomic characteristics of actors were identified using statistical means comparisons. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the socioeconomic factors that correlated with peoples' role in the value chain. Results showed that the new market has introduced new individuals who interact with pre-existing buriti users. Actors differ by livelihood strategy, socioeconomic factors, and perceptions regarding sustainability of leaf collection. Social heterogeneity in NTFP value chains should be considered by initiatives that seek to influence participation in NTFP markets, evaluate effects of commercialization on livelihoods, and effectively design and implement resource management strategies. © 2014 This work was authored as part of the Contributor's official duties as an Employee of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

This paper reviews the multiple dimensions of and recent trends in NTFP governance. It emphasises that NTFP governance is more than rule-making and includes a broader societal process based on social practices, values and principles. This process is characterised by the coexistence of formal and informal institutions based on plural statutory, customary and market norms; the combination of forestry and agrarian regimes; multilevel and multi-actor involvement in many - but usually not all - of these arrangements; and largely separate institutions that govern access to resources and markets. NTFP governance is characterised by an increasingly complex and dynamic hybrid of institutional arrangements, norms and collective social practices and by cross-scale dynamics in space and over time. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.","access rights; bricolage; forest governance; governance; livelihoods; markets; non-timber forest products; value chains","access restriction; decision making; forest management; forestry production; governance approach; institutional framework; legal rights; marketing; nontimber forest product","Wiersum, K.F.; Forest and Nature Conservation Policy Group, Wageningen University, Wageningen, Netherlands; email: Freerk.Wiersum@wur.nl",,"A B Academic Publishers",14728028,,FTLOA,,"English","For.

High-value products are primarily male-harvested when customary rules govern tenure and access, enabling men to exert control. Whilst non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are important cash sources for both sexes, women tend to use more of their harvest for domestic consumption, while men sell a greater proportion. Interventions by research and development organisations, NGOs and projects have positively influenced women's incomes in some NTFP chains. Suggestions include supporting women's domesticating and cultivating NTFPs currently pressured by over-harvesting; recognising the informal, often invisible nature of value chains; addressing unfavourable customary norms restricting the possession of valuable species by women; revising bureaucratic trade regulations; improving value-adding opportunities and supporting collective action to access credit and increasing bargaining power. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Cameroon; Central Africa; Congo; Gabon; gender; governance; livelihoods; non-timber forest products; trade; value chains","gender role; governance approach; nongovernmental organization; nontimber forest product; public access; regulatory framework; research and development; resource use; tenure system; trade; womens status; Congo; Congo Basin; Gabon","Ingram, V.; Sustainable Markets and Chains Group, Agricultural Economics Institute (LEI), Wageningen University, P.O.

Participation is constrained mainly by low product prices, limited access rights to forests, and lack of information on product quality and prices. Regional differences exist regarding access rights to forests and the chains. In northwestern Ethiopia, factors positively influencing participation were the gender of the household head, whether advice was provided by extension workers, and the level of farm income and farm size, indicating that poor people have lesser access to gums and resins. Access to formal credit and perceptions of problems of transport negatively and significantly affect participation. In southern Ethiopia, participation was positively influenced by the number of livestock owned, while distance to the forest and perception of transport problems had negative effects. Two major value chains and eight major marketing channels were identified. Profit margins varied between 12% and 28% for producers and between 14% and 53% for exporters. Improving access to and use of dry forests for gums and resins, encouraging sustained involvement of companies, and building capacity to add value are measures recommended to enhance incentives for collectors to responsibly manage dry forests. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","cooperatives; NTFP value chains; policy; profit margins; smallholder producers","farm size; forest management; forestry policy; forestry production; income; market conditions; participatory approach; perception; smallholder; sustainability; Ethiopia","Kassa, H.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), Ethiopia Office, P.O.

Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa seed) is one of the most important NTFP in the Amazon basin and has received considerable attention from researchers aiming to guarantee its sustainability. However, most studies evaluating the impacts of B. excelsa seed harvesting investigated only effects in harvested sites, and did not consider B. excelsa availability in the landscape, or patterns of harvesting at broader scales, which are critical to evaluate the viability of extraction and plan management practices. We used high-resolution satellite images associated with ground truthing, participative mapping with harvesters and harvest records, to evaluate abundance of B. excelsa in the territories of three Kayapó indigenous communities in southeastern Amazonia. This allowed us to obtain conservative estimates of the proportion of Brazil nut harvested by the Kayapó at scales appropriate to evaluate effects on stocks in the landscape and in harvested groves. B. excelsa groves are abundant in the Kayapó lands, but only about 30% of them are harvested. In recent years, the villagers have harvested from 7.2% to 43% of the seeds produced in harvested groves. These represent only 2.5-12.7% of total seeds estimated to have been produced within the Brazil nut-collection territories of those Kayapó villages. Our results show that the Kayapó have undertaken non-intensive Brazil nut harvesting at local and especially at landscape scales, which suggests that B. excelsa is currently not threatened by harvesting in the region and that there is still potential to expand commercial production in at least one of the sites. The application of similar multi-scale approaches in other sites and for other non-timber forest products would provide important information to evaluate their long term conservation, subsidize the development of management plans and help to guarantee the livelihoods of traditional communities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Bertholletia excelsa; Kayapó; Landscape; Non-timber forest products; Satellite image","Bertholletia excelsa; Commercial productions; High resolution satellite images; Landscape; Long-term conservation; Multi-scale approaches; Non-timber forest products; Satellite images; Conservation; Forestry; Rural areas; Harvesting; commercial activity; deciduous forest; edible species; harvesting; indigenous population; nontimber forest product; satellite imagery; spatial analysis; sustainability; traditional knowledge; Amazon Basin; Amazonia","Ribeiro, M.B.N.; Coordenação de Biodiversidade, CP 2223, 69080-971 Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil; email: ribeiro.mbn@gmail.com",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Wild edible plants (WEPs) are a particularly common and effective coping strategy used to increase socio-ecological resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa where agricultural systems are often sensitive to environmental perturbations and instability. WEPs are collected across the landscape, from agricultural areas to government-managed hilltops with varying degrees of success and legality. This multiple case study research, conducted in Eastern Province, Kenya, investigates the formal forest regulations and land tenure rights, as well as local enforcement and understanding of those rules, in order to understand their impact on the ability of vulnerable populations to use WEPs as a coping strategy. The results suggest that widespread confusion, trust issues and a strong focus on the commercialization of wild foods are limiting the possible contribution of WEPs to food security and increased socio-ecological resilience. We identify a number of policy changes and extension programs that could better support local communities relying on WEPs for subsistence purposes to improve their adaptive capacity. © 2013 The Authors.","Community forest management (CFM); East Africa; Land tenure; Non-timber forest product (NTFP) commercialization; Sustainable development; Tharaka","adaptive management; commercialization; common land; community resource management; coping strategy; edible species; food security; forest management; harvesting; institutional framework; land rights; land tenure; nontimber forest product; plant; policy reform; semiarid region; sustainable development; wild population; East Africa; Eastern Province [Kenya]; Kenya; Tharaka","Shumsky, S.; Department of Natural Resource Sciences, 21, 111 Lakeshore, Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC H9X 3V9, Canada; email: steph.shumsky@gmail.com",,,02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887746857

We studied the effect of four decades of palm heart extraction from the clonal palm Euterpe oleracea at the southern Pacific coast of Colombia. We monitored populations that had been subject to a range of harvest intensities and used measured vital rates (survival, growth, sexual and clonal reproduction) to construct population matrix models. We then used these models to simulate several harvest scenarios and to project the population dynamics for the next 50. years. Our projections suggest that the currently implemented intensive harvest regimes - which involve up to four harvests per year - result in dramatic demographic changes, primarily affecting seedlings and adults. In addition, current harvest regimes affect the future supply of palm heart, which is projected to drop sharply during the first years following harvest and fails to recover unless a number of stems are spared. Our simulations indicate that the most sustainable scenarios involve annual harvest between 50% and 75% of all harvestable stems, without any removal of small shoots from the clumps. Implementation of this regime must be accompanied by other management practices, including planning harvestable areas, marking the stems to be cut during subsequent harvests, assigning harvesters to specific areas, and leaving harvest residues as mulch around clumps. The degradation of populations of E oleracea directly affects livelihoods of local people, by reducing cash income from palm heart sales and by reducing availability of palm fruits, a locally important food resource. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Arecaceae; NTFP; Population dynamics; Sustainable management; Transient dynamics; Use",,"Vallejo, M.I.Calle 127 B bis No. 53 c 28, Bloque 8, Apto 412, Niza IX-2 Bogotá, Colombia; email: mivallejoj@unal.edu.co",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The emphasis shifted from commodity timber production to ensuring sustained ecological functioning to meet a broad array of ecosystem services including economic benefits. Under interim guidelines of the NWFP, approximately 1.1. million. ha are allocated to riparian reserves intended to conserve the ecological functions and processes required to create and maintain habitat for aquatic and riparian-dependent organisms. The Density Management and Riparian Buffer Study (DMS), an operational-scale management experiment, has evaluated the effectiveness of alternative buffer widths in meeting ecological objectives for riparian areas in headwater forests subjected to spatially heterogeneous thinning. Observations in unthinned stream-reaches revealed spatial structuring of amphibian and invertebrate species assemblages in relation to headwater habitats. Riparian buffers defined by the transition between distinct riparian habitat features and upslope forest were sufficient to moderate the effect of thinning on near-stream microclimates and wetted streambed temperatures. These same variable-width buffers were less effective when adjacent to 0.4-ha patch openings. Thinning had little impact on the abundance of aquatic amphibians and there was no evidence of species loss. Results of the study are being used to devise headwater forest management and species conservation strategies, and to improve monitoring methods and watershed assessment tools. © 2013.","Amphibians; Large-scale management experiment; Microclimate; Riparian buffers; Variable-density thinning",,"Anderson, P.D.; US Department of Agriculture, , Corvallis, OR, United States; email: pdanderson@fs.fed.us",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Six Kebeles (the lowest administrative unit in Ethiopia) were sampled from two Districts and 150 households were randomly sampled using proportional-to-size techniques based on the number of farm households in each Kebele. Secondary data were collected from and focus group discussions were conducted with selected individuals. The farmers diversified livelihood activities such as crop and livestock production, collection of NTFPs and off-farm activities. NTFPs played a significant role in household incomes. The contribution from the major NTFPs (forest coffee, honey and spices) accounted for 47% of annual household income. The role of NTFPs was influenced by a number of factors. Variables including being native to the area (+), total land holding (+), possession of livestock (+) and access to extension (+) significantly affected forest coffee production. Age of household head (-), land holding (+) and distance of the market from the residence (-) significantly affected honey production. Size of landholding (+), distance to market (-) and distance of the forest from the residence (-) were significant variables determining the NTFP incomes derived by the households.

Based on the literature, we devised a list of the conditions under which supply-side interventions may yield positive conservation outcomes. We applied it to the trade of the orchid Rhynchostylis gigantea, a protected ornamental plant. We conducted a survey of R. gigantea at Jatujak Market in Bangkok, Thailand. Farmed (legal) and wild (illegal, protected) specimens of R. gigantea were sold side-by-side at market. These results suggest farmed specimens are not being substituted for wild plants in the marketplace. For any given set of physical plant characteristics (size, condition, flowers), the origin of the plants (wild vs. farmed) did not affect price. For all price classes, farmed plants were of superior quality to wild-collected plants on the basis of most physical variables. These results suggest wild and farmed specimens represent parallel markets and may not be substitutable goods. Our results with R. gigantea highlight a range of explanations for why supply-side interventions may lack effectiveness, for example, consumer preferences for wild-collected products and low financial incentives for farming. Our results suggest that market-based conservation strategies may not be effective by themselves and may be best utilized as supplements to regulation and education. This approach represents a broad, multidisciplinary evaluation of supply-side interventions that can be applied to other plant and animal species. © 2013 Society for Conservation Biology.","CITES; Cultivation; Domestication; Harvest; Nontimber forest products; NTFP; Orchid; Trade; Wildlife farming","demand-side management; environmental economics; financial system; orchard; ornamental species; plant community; wildlife management; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand; Animalia; Orchidaceae; Rhynchostylis gigantea; article; CITES; comercio; commercial phenomena; cosecha; cultivation; cultivo; domesticación; domestication; economics; environmental protection; harvest; methodology; nontimber forest products; NTFP; Orchidaceae; orquídea; productos forestales no maderables; Thailand; trade; wildlife farming; zoocría; CITES; comercio; cosecha; cultivation; cultivo; domesticación; domestication; harvest; nontimber forest products; NTFP; orchid; orquídea; productos forestales no maderables; trade; wildlife farming; zoocría; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Orchidaceae; Thailand","Phelps, J.; Department of Biological Sciences, 14 Science Dr. 4, Singapore, 117543, Singapore; email: jacob.phelps@gmail.com",,,08888892,,CBIOE,"24471784","English","Conserv.

The role of tree size and xylem anatomy at distal parts (≥10cm) aside from the tapping wound in the resin yield potential of this species was evaluated. Twenty-six tapped trees with contrasting resin yield classes and 12 non-tapped (control) trees, growing in two locations with the same climate conditions but different stand density and soil characteristics, were selected for the study. In tissues not affected by the tapping wound, the number of radial resin canals per mm2 and resin canal volume per growth ring unit are related to resin yield. The number of radial canals per mm2 and resin yield are strongly related to tree diameter and percentage of live crown. The area per mm2 of axial resin canals is related to high yielding trees, but only in the location with higher plant density and poorer soil quality. In tapped trees, an increase in axial canal frequency and area was found during the three years following the start of tapping activity, suggesting that canal formation is a systemic induced response to wounding. Tree diameter and percentage of live crown and radial resin canal frequency could be useful criteria for estimating resin yields in P. pinaster and could be applied to improve tapping management and breeding programs. The systemic defense system of trees should be taken into account to improve tapping techniques and resin yield. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Defense system; NWFP; Resin canals; Tapping; Xylem wounding","Canals; Hydraulic structures; Resins; Tapping (threads); Breeding program; Climate condition; Defense system; NWFP; Pinus pinaster ait; Resin canals; Soil characteristics; Xylem wounding; Forestry; anatomy; climate conditions; coniferous tree; defense mechanism; diameter; extraction method; plant breeding; resin; soil quality; stand structure; wounding; xylem; Forestry; Synthetic Polymers; Tapping; Water Ways; Xylem; Coniferophyta; Embryophyta; Pinus pinaster; Tracheophyta","Gil, L.; Forest Genetics and Physiology Research Group, E.T.S.

Muslims from different parts of British India might have been brought together by their support for the Leagues Pakistan demand in the months leading up to independence, but it took very little time once Pakistan had been created for pre-existing distinctions to re-emerge. For all the rhetoric about becoming Pakistanis, the identities of its new citizens usually depended on, and were linked to, the provinces from whence they originally hailed, whether this was the Punjab, Bengal or places that had become India. One of the major divides was between those who migrated to Pakistan and those already living in what became the state in August 1947. This article, drawing on official records and contemporary newspaper reports, engages with the question of these rivalries in the context of the federal capital Karachis security apparatus in the decade that followed independence. In particular, it highlights the intense rivalry that developed between the Karachi Police and the Pakistan Special Police Establishment (set up in 1948), which eventually resulted in the ousting of Sir Gilbert Grace from his post as British Inspector General of Police in Karachi, in 1956 amid mutual accusations of police corruption and malpractice. While the vast majority of Karachis non-Muslim police officers had left for India by the beginning of the 1950s, a new power struggle quickly emerged in the federal capital between refugee displaced officers on the one hand and officers from the Punjab and North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) on the other. In effect, this provincial competition mirrored the wider manoeuvring for power and influence that was taking place as Pakistans newly established services sought to accommodate the different sets of interests that came together after 1947. The resulting power struggle can also tell us a great deal about the role of the police in the everyday lives of the ordinary citizens who had made Karachi their home, demonstrating just how far people relied on possessing the right social connections to protect their interests in the context of Pakistans early years. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","corruption; ethnic politics; Karachi; police; provincial rivalries",,"Ansari, S.; Department of History, Royal Holloway, Egham, United Kingdom; email: s.ansari@rhul.ac.uk",,,19472498,,,,"English","South Asian Hist.

Political and electoral trends suddenly changed in the NWFP during 1946–47. The electoral trends during the 1946 elections were favourable towards the All India National Congress. It was also observed that during the next one year, that is, in the 1947 referendum, electoral behaviour turned towards the All India Muslim League. The study of this surprising change in electoral behaviour during 1946–47 is unique in the colonial electoral history of the NWFP. In this article, an attempt has been made to explore the electoral trends in the NWFP during the 1946 elections and the referendum in 1947. Some basic questions are also addressed, that is, why did the Congress get a considerable electoral victory in the NWFP in 1946? How did electoral trends change in favour of the Muslim League after one year in the 1947 referendum? How did de-alignment occur in the electoral politics of the NWFP? What were those leading factors that affected electoral behaviour during period under study? Many social scientists and historians focused on electoral trends in descriptive form and no compact study was undertaken on the basis of electoral theories.

Community participation should enable local people to take ownership of the monitoring and ensure that it is cost-effective. But even then, success is often elusive. We developed a participatory Non Timber Forest Product (NTFP) monitoring system in 6 upland villages of Luang Prabang Province, Lao PDR, using focus group discussions, interviews, village meetings and direct observations. We used simple approaches to select resources, discuss issues, and develop a cost-effective NTFP monitoring system. Communities usually relied on shifting cultivation, fishing and collection of NTFPs. Gold mining activities affected livelihoods in three villages, which had better access to markets. Participatory monitoring looks less successful when external economic pressures or a major environmental threat disturbs local livelihoods. In the case of gold mining, we observed the prioritization of villagers' activities towards this sudden new economic opportunity. In contrast, communities not impacted by mining participated more actively in data collection. They understood how the data could be used to influence the local government, to achieve more beneficial land management for all stakeholders concerned. We believe that participatory NTFP monitoring can work and is an important tool for decision-making and economic empowerment for local communities. We identified the conditions under which participatory NTFP monitoring could work: reaching a shared understanding of what needs to be monitored and how; testing and refining a simple monitoring system; and integrating local government concerns with those of other stakeholders. © 2013 The Author(s).","Adaptive management; Lao PDR; Multi-stakeholders; NTFP; Participatory monitoring system","adaptive management; decision making; economic activity; environmental planning; local government; mining; nontimber forest product; participatory approach; prioritization; resource assessment; stakeholder; sustainable development; Laos; Luang Prabang","Boissière, M.; Centre de Coopération Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le Developpement (CIRAD), Campus de Baillarguet, 34398 Montpellier Cedex 5, France; email: m.boissiere@cgiar.org",,,09603115,,BONSE,,"English","Biodiversity Conserv.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891665164

Economic theory predicts that households will maintain diversified strategies when faced with risk; however, many studies have claimed that openness to markets drives specialisation to enhance returns. Nevertheless, there is little evidence about the association between trade in non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and the diversity of NTFPs consumed. Relying on a household survey and systematic observations of Brazilian Amazonian Caboclos, we evaluated whether exposure to NTFP markets (effort and cash income) correlates with the diversity of NTFPs consumed (richness and Simpson diversity). The results were conflicting. First, there was variation across NTFP subtypes: although the variety (richness) of terrestrial NTFPs consumed (vegetables and hunted animals) was greater in households trading NTFPs, the richness of fish consumed was lower because fishing could not be pursued concurrently with activities related to NTFP trade. Second, the observed effects differed across indicators of diversity, which shows that intensification in the use of a few resources may occur. Third, the associations with alternative definitions of exposure to the NTFP market also differed. These results indicate that NTFP markets do not necessarily undermine local consumption diversity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Caboclos; Diversification; Hunting; Market integration; Non-timber forest product","consumption behavior; ecological economics; economic theory; household survey; hunting; market development; nontimber forest product; trade-off; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil","Morsello, C.; Escola de Artes, Rua Arlindo Béttio, 1000, CEP: 03828-000 São Paulo, Brazil; email: morsello@usp.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

The discussion of forest management therefore encompasses a wide range of social, economic, political, and ecological questions. Empirically, it is clear that both market and government failure can lead to unsustainable management in commercial NTFP use. How can we manage the market and at the same time formulate good policies? Taking cases from Southwest China, this paper critically examines the current development of NTFP commercialization in the mountainous region of Southwest China. It focuses particularly on three pieces of research on mushroom collection and marketing. By examining empirical data, the paper analyzes current gaps in the policy and the market in mountainous areas in the context of promoting sustainable use of NTFP. It examines the market structure from the perspective of market failure and explores the government's failure to promote commercial NTFPs.

It aims to compare and contrast the significance of NTFPs for income generation in rainforest areas, both within and across these countries to draw out regional patterns in a wider ecological, social and political context. In doing so, we bring the added value of highlighting the different roles which NTFPs currently play, or might likely begin to play out, in wider landscapes. The contribution NTFPs make to rural livelihoods depends largely on the availability of forest resources and access to markets, as well as socio-economic variables including wealth, gender and migration status. The findings indicate that remote communities and poorer households rely more on NTFP-based income compared to more accessible communities and wealthier households. NTFPs are relatively unimportant as an income source for households in more accessible rural areas, where farm-related income dominates. These findings support the theory that NTFPs are an important component to rural livelihoods and make significant and timely income contributions to poor households. Furthermore, in times of economic and climatic uncertainty, NTFPs and the forest and agricultural landscapes within which they are found, make a significant contribution to the resilience of rural forest dwellers' livelihoods.","Household surveys; Multi-functional landscapes; NTFPs; Resilience; West africa","forest ecosystem; forestry production; household survey; nontimber forest product; rainforest; rural society; uncertainty analysis; Cameroon; Ghana; Nigeria",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

And yet this knowledge is rarely drawn upon in debates around and design of poverty alleviation or land use policies, strategies and projects. Unless the accumulating wealth of empirical evidence can be translated into policies and approaches at higher levels, and integrated into poverty alleviation programmes, it will have little impact on local and national poverty profiles. In this paper we propose and briefly discuss eight steps to facilitate integration of NTFPs into the development agenda, for the benefit of local communities. These include: (1) proper inventory of NTFP stocks, (2) research on NTFP ecology and sustainable harvest levels, (3) introduction of extension services for NTFPs, (4) inclusion of NTFPs in land management and trade-off decisions, (5) integration of NTFPs into sectoral policies, (6) ensuring NTFP commercialisation is not at the expense of local livelihood needs, (7) promoting security of access and use, and (8) examination of local contextual drivers of unsustainable use.

These new laws emphasized block-based, collectivized extraction - a strategy incompatible with local communities' logging traditions and technical capacity. Field surveys before and after the policy change revealed a drastic reduction in local logging activities for households at all income levels. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) subsequently became more important to household cash incomes. However, only some households were able to shift to a more intensive and far-ranging pattern of NTFP harvest, particularly households with boats and motors. Others lost income from both logging and NTFP extraction because for many households, these income sources were interdependent. An increasing Gini coefficient signals potentially escalating household income inequality. Key lessons for biodiversity and forest-carbon interventions in tropical forests include 1) regulations designed to control large-scale extraction can lead to unnecessarily restricted access for small-scale extractors, and 2) potential shifts in extractive pressure should be taken into account when access to forest resources is curtailed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Forest dependence; Income shock; Logging reform; NTFPs; Poverty; Smallholders; Timber; Tropical forests","adaptation; extraction; forest resource; household income; poverty; sustainability; timber; tropical forest; Amazon River","L'Roe, J.; Department of Geography, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 550 North Park Street, Madison, WI 53706-1404, United States; email: jelong@wisc.edu",,"Elsevier",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

However, most research on illegal forest activities deals with illegal timber harvesting with little efforts on other activities like Non Timber Forest Products (NTFP). In Cameroon, commercial exploitation of most NTFP is regulated by a permit system. However a majority of traders who sell these products do not have the necessary permits. The objective of this paper is to assess and use transactions costs economics (TCs) to explain why traders in Cameroon do not comply with regulations on permits. Results show that the process to obtain permits may require more than 26,000 USD and may require regular monitoring during a time span of more than 4. years. Analyses of traders' perceptions illustrate that the major sources of high TCs in the forest sector are the perceived complex administrative procedures and information asymmetry on procedures and the requirements to obtain permits. The study concludes that it is the impracticality to abide to high TCs rather than the inclination to disobey the law that pushes traders to operate without permits. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Cameroon; Forest law; Illegal forest activities; NTFP; Trade permits; Transactions costs","Cameroon; Forest activities; Forest law; NTFP; Transactions costs; Crime; Laws and legislation; Logging (forestry); Timber; Commerce; Commerce; Costs; Forests; Logging","Foundjem-Tita, D.; Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; email: dftita@yahoo.com",,,13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

We investigated whether the knowledge of expert forest harvesters can be used to determine the habitat distribution and harvesting sites of three popular edible wild ferns, i.e., ostrich fern (Matteuccia struthiopteris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), and royal fern (Osmunda japonica), in mountainous communities of western Fukushima, Japan. Using multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and geographic information system (GIS), we found that harvesters were easily able to recognize differences in the spatial characteristics of the habitat distribution of fern species due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. These factors were described by various GIS layers, such as vegetation and terrain features (e.g., gradient, aspect, and slope position) derived from a 20-m digital elevation model (DEM). Harvesting sites were limited by their distance from a roadway, which differed among species. By comparison with the GPS records of actual harvesting sites, we estimated the potential harvesting sites of each fern species with reasonable accuracy, particularly for bracken. Our results show that the knowledge of expert forest harvesters can be quantified using MCE and GIS, which is useful for determining the spatial characteristics of NTFP harvesting and ensuring sustainable management practices. © 2013 by the authors.","AHP; Ecosystem services; Fukushima prefecture; GIS; Multi-criteria evaluation; NTFP","estimation method; fern; GIS; habitat availability; knowledge based system; montane forest; site investigation; Fukushima; Honshu; Japan; Tohoku","Matsuura, T.; Department of Forest Management, Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, 1 Matsunosato, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8687, Japan; email: matsuu50@affrc.go.jp",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894071755

Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) has been central to many Amazonian reserves and resident livelihoods therein, due to its basin-wide distribution, significance in global markets, and potential for sustainable use and forest conservation. Yet, do the benefits of this and other NTFPs extend to all extractive reserve residents? A livelihood survey, structured interviews, and Brazil nut inventories from 2008 to 2010, randomly sampling the widely dispersed households and corresponding forests across the three regions of Riozinho do Anfrísio Extractive Reserve (RDAER), revealed significant social and ecological heterogeneity among RDAER regions. There were differences in Brazil nut stand access, individual tree characteristics (including crown form and marginally, and fruit production), stand and tree management, multiple household characteristics that shape resident investment and dependence on NTFPs, and the contribution of Brazil nut to forest-based income. If Brazil nut and other NTFPs are to reconcile conservation and development in forest communities, then policies to regulate and promote NTFP use must integrate the socioecological heterogeneity inherent in these forest products and within reserve polygons. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2013.","Bertholletia excelsa; conservation; forest management; household income; Keywords: Amazonia; livelihoods; non-timber forest products","Conservation; Economics; International trade; Regional planning; Conservation; Ecology; Economics; International trade; Regional planning; Timber; Amazonia; Bertholletia excelsa; Household income; livelihoods; Non-timber forest products; Forestry; Forestry; forest inventory; forest management; geographical distribution; heterogeneity; household income; nontimber forest product; nut; sustainability; economic planning; forest ecosystem; forest product; investment; natural resource; polygon; timber; Conservation; Economics; Foreign Trade; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests; Fruits; Sustainable Forest Management; Amazonia; Brazil; Bertholletia excelsa","Kainer, K.A.; School of Forestry Resources and Conservation, University of Florida, 210 Newins-Ziegler Hall, Gainesville, FL 32611-0410, United States; email: kkainer@ufl.edu",,"Cambridge University Press",03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

However, only a small number of studies have addressed the impacts of NTFP harvesting on the reproductive phenology of the exploited species. The aim of this observational study was to assess the effects of harvesting and climatic variables on the reproductive phenology of Himatanthus drasticus, a highly exploited medicinal tree from the Brazilian savanna (Cerrado). We evaluated the effects of two different debarking levels (50 and 100%) in comparison to a control (no harvesting). We performed monthly counts of the number of buds, flowers in anthesis, unripe and ripe fruits in each sampled tree (intensity index), as well as the number of trees in each phenophase (activity index), over 2 yr. We used circular statistics tools to compare the effects of each treatment on flower and fruit production and to test whether the reproductive peaks were related to climatic variables. Both the activity and intensity indexes exhibited the same patterns; flower and fruit production were lower in the control, intermediate in the 50 percent debarking group and higher in the 100 percent debarking group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of NTFP to demonstrate an increase in reproductive activity after several years of harvesting. All phenophases were positively correlated with higher temperature and precipitation, as it is common in the Cerrado. © 2014 The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Cerrado; Chapada do Araripe phenology; Circular statistics; Janaguba; Medicinal plants; Sustainable management","Apocynaceae; Himatanthus","Baldauf, C.; Department of Plant Biology, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), CP 6109, Campinas, SP, CEP 13083-970, Brazil; email: crisbaldauf@ufersa.edu.br",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00063606,,BTROA,,"English","Biotropica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899929842

In order to help ensure long-term supply, the KFS and NFCF support and undertake forest management activities.

In this paper we estimate transferable household production functions of NTFP extraction in the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) in Tanzania, based on information from seven multi-site datasets related to the behaviour of over 2000 households. The study shows that the total benefit flow of charcoal, firewood, poles and thatch from the EAM to the local population has an estimated value of USD 42. million per year, and provides an important source of additional income for local communities, especially the poorest, who mainly depend on subsistence agriculture. The resulting map of economic values shows that benefits vary highly across space with population density, infrastructure and resource availability. We argue that if further restrictions on forest access to promote conservation are considered, this will require additional policies to prevent a consequent increase in poverty, and an enforced trade-off between conservation and energy supply to rural and urban households. © 2013.","Benefit transfer; Ecosystem services; Environmental valuation; Forest conservation; Non-Timber Forest Products",,"Schaafsma, M.; Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, , Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom; email: m.schaafsma@uea.ac.uk",,,09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

By promoting systematic and sustainable harvesting of forest products, the exploitation of forest resources can be reduced and the socio-economic status of marginal forest dwellers can also be improved, which will subsequently reduce illegal timber harvesting. In India, brief guidelines for the harvesting of NTFPs are placed in the Joint Forest Management resolution. However, these guidelines are not equally effective in all states because of micro-level geophysical variances, forest-human relationships and the characteristics of the forests. Therefore, some south Indian states such as Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh have developed their own NTFP harvesting policy for the sustainable management of forests through the socio-economic enhancement of forest dwellers. However, in West Bengal the central government's guidelines are still followed.

The influence of market access on the type of dependency is significant. This study examines the relationship between market access and the harvesting of NWFPs as well as the limitations and problems in gathering and selling these products. Cornelian cherry, walnut and plum were the most commonly harvested species. Of the 13 NWFP species collected in Arasbaran forests, just three species, cornelian cherry, plum and pomegranate were sold in the local markets. The average contribution of NWFPs towards total household income was just 2.7%.

The aim of this study was therefore to establish a base level of understanding of the operational core values of (NTFPs) in a develop country. Data was collected through structured self-administered questionnaires and interview. A multi stage sampling procedure was used to select the respondents. Data analysis included using descriptive statistics involving the use of percentage and tables as well as regression analysis as the statistical tools. Findings from previous literature revealed that there are constraints faced in the operations of (NTFPs). The field survey confirmed some of the operational challenges to include Lack of marketing, distance from forest as well as over exploitation. The findings also identified the search for solutions to these challenges by providing an insight for further research regarding the institutional weaknesses and policy issues in this part of the world. The implications of the findings are that unless the limitations named above are resolved, NTFPs in a developing nation will continue to experience poor economic growth, development and display inferior competitiveness. Recommendations to overcome these challenges are suggested. © 2014, Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research.

Management recommendations by Ticktin et al. (2012) were based on the assumptions of invasiveness of a native mistletoe and grazing impacts of wild ungulates.

In order to record and document the contribution of S. birrea to household food supplies to communal farmers in south-central Zimbabwe, one hundred and sixteen participants from 4 villages were interviewed between December 2011 and January 2012. Data collected included traditional and medicinal uses of S. birrea; fruit harvesting, processing and income generation activities from S. birrea and its products. The main product harvested by the participants was the fruit. The ripe fruits were eaten raw (100 %), seed kernels were eaten raw (100 %) or roasted (33.6 %), fruit juice fermented to produce children's beverage (22.4 %) or traditional beer (35.3 %), making jam (14.7 %), oil processing (8.6 %) and added to maize, millet and sorghum porridge (4.3 %). S. birrea was used medicinally for cold and flu, diarrhea, sore eyes and toothache. The leaves and fruits were browsed by livestock. S. birrea is also an important non-timber forest product (NTFP) for generating income among rural communities in south-central Zimbabwe with oil, wooden crafts and utensils generating the most cash income. This study showed that S. birrea plays an important role in the socio-cultural life of rural communities in south-central Zimbabwe. These results confirm findings from other studies conducted in rural communities in developing countries that wild plant resources are important for household livelihoods. © 2014, © 2014 Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.","Medicinal use; rural communities; Sclerocarya birrea; south-central Zimbabwe; traditional knowledge","Sclerocarya birrea; Zea mays","Maroyi, A.; Medicinal Plants and Economic Development (MPED) Research Centre, Botany Department, University of Fort Hare, Private Bag X1314, South Africa",,"Har Krishan Bhalla and Sons",0972060X,,,,"English","J.

Several studies have been carried out to analyze the success of smallholder certification, with a focus on its feasibility, compliance with sustainability standards and livelihoods effects. Much less attention has been given to certification as a process that promotes the empowerment and inclusion of small producers in natural resource management. Based on a study of three Amazon nut (Bertholletia excelsa) certifications (Forest Stewardship Council, organic and Fairtrade) carried out in Madre de Dios, Peru, in 2008 and 2010 this paper aims to fill part of the gap by assessing five empowerment outcomes of Amazon nut certification schemes nearly a decade after their introduction. The findings show that certification enhances producers' political empowerment (having a voice based on representation and social organization and increased self-confidence in one's ability to effect change) by increasing their organizational capacity and managerial know-how. However, limited demand, monetary benefits and economic viability are major constraints on their economic empowerment (increased assets and capabilities that enable them to benefit from new opportunities and freedom to make economic decisions). The authors argue that only stronger social organization will enable certification to break the hierarchical economic structures that disadvantage producers and prevent their replacement with new dependencies on donor and NGO support. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Amazon nut; Empowerment; Non-timber forest product certification; Peru; Social capital","community forestry; economic structure; empowerment; forest management; nongovernmental organization; smallholder; social capital; sustainability; timber; Amazonia; Madre de Dios; Peru; Bertholletia excelsa","Ros-Tonen, M.A.F.; Department of Human Geography, Plantage Muidergracht 14, 1018 TV Amsterdam, Netherlands; email: m.a.f.ros-tonen@uva.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",07430167,,JRSTF,,"English","J.

These supplementary and alternative sources of food, often referred to as non-timber forest products (NTFPs), are especially crucial in years of crop failure — usually the result of extreme climatic events (droughts and floods), disease and pest outbreaks and other natural disasters. Trade in a wide range of NTFPs can provide a source of income that allows the purchase of food for both dietary diversification and to supplement calorie intake in periods of shortage, indirectly contributing to food security. Such increased consumption and use of NTFPs in times of stress can be viewed as an effective autonomous coping mechanism for dealing with threats to food security and is likely to expand under predicted climate change. Yet, we know little about how climate change, interacting with other drivers of change, will impact the world’s forests and woodlands and, more particularly, the range of products that people rely on. Limited research has been undertaken to consider how changes in climate may affect the distribution, productivity or availability of the wild species that people use for food and other purposes. More research is required at the interface between food security and the ecosystem services provided forests, woodlands and associated ecosystems, and the linkages to agriculture and climate change.

In tropical forests, much attention has focused on the extent to which carbon-based conservation provided by REDD+ policies can also mitigate biodiversity conservation. In the nearly one-third of tropical forests that are community owned or managed, conservation strategies must also balance the multiple uses of forest products that support local livelihoods. Although much discussion has focused on policy options, little empirical evidence exists to evaluate the potential for trade-offs among different tropical forest value components. We assessed multiple components of forest value, including tree diversity, carbon stocks, and both timber and nontimber forest product resources, in forest communities across the trinational frontier of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. We installed 69 0.5-ha vegetation plots in local communities, and we characterized 15 components of forest value for each plot. Principal components analyses revealed two major axes of forest value, the first of which defined a trade-off between diversity of woody plant communities (taxonomic and functional) versus aboveground biomass and standing timber volume. The second axis described abundance of commercial species, with strong positive loadings for density of timber and nontimber forest products, including Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and copaiba oil (Copaifera spp.). The observed trade-off between different components of forest value suggests a potential for management conflicts prioritizing biodiversity conservation versus carbon stocks in the region. We discuss the potential for integrative indices of forest value for tropical forest conservation. © 2014 by the author(s).

These trees are important sources of nutrients and income to thousands of farmers. However data on farmers' perceptions and behaviour towards such policy instruments are scarce and contradictory. Based on data collected from 394 households in Cameroon, using a structured questionnaire, farmers' awareness, perception and willingness to accept policy instruments governing on-farm trees were assessed. The study further investigated whether the policy instruments would affect their intentions to plant selected indigenous fruit trees on their farms. The analysis found that a majority of farmers are unaware of the laws governing access and trade in indigenous fruit tree species. Furthermore, even if strictly applied, a significant majority of farmers (60%) would not be discouraged by the regulations, from planting trees on their farms because it constitutes part of their traditional farming practices. Yet, the authors argue that planting of indigenous fruit tree species could increase under simplified rules, as 40% of the farmers do claim they would refuse to plant such trees if existing regulations are strictly enforced. The study therefore concludes that there is a need for new policies to attract more farmers to integrate indigenous fruit trees on their farms. Given the current trend to encourage on-farm tree planting to address food security and climate change issues, this is especially relevant. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Cameroon; Farmers' perception; Indigenous fruit trees; NTFP; Policy instruments; Tree planting","agricultural practice; agroforestry; farmers attitude; food production; food security; forestry policy; forestry production; fruit; perception; policy approach; regulatory approach; tree planting; Cameroon","Foundjem-Tita, D.; World Agroforestry Centre, West and Central African Region (ICRAF-WCA), P.O.

We examined the potential effects of different harvesting regimes on the population dynamics of the epiphytic bromeliads Tillandsia multicaulis and Tillandsia punctulata. The population dynamics of these species were studied over a 2-year period in a tropical montane cloud forest in Veracruz, Mexico. Prospective and retrospective analyses were used to identify which demographic processes and life-cycle stages make the largest relative contribution to variation in population growth rate (λ). The effect of simulated harvesting levels on population growth rates was analysed for both species. λ of both populations was highly influenced by survival (stasis), to a lesser extent by growth, and only slightly by fecundity. Vegetative growth played a central role in the population dynamics of these organisms. The λ value of the studied populations did not differ significantly from unity: T.multicaulis λ (95% confidence interval)=0.982 (0.897-1.060) and T.punctulata λ=0.967 (0.815-1.051), suggesting population stability. However, numerical simulation of different levels of extraction showed that λ would drop substantially even under very low (2%) harvesting levels.

Moreover, it is believed that their low adaptive capacity and high dependence on resources sensitive to climatic changes makes them even more vulnerable to climate change. Adaptive capacity refers to the potential or ability of a community to cope with, adapt to or recover from the effects of an exposure (Adger, 2003). Rural access to alternative livelihoods (such as indigenous fruit trees) and degradation of these livelihoods during climatic stresses touch upon the crosscutting themes in this book: environment, equity and livelihoods. Rural people at tropical forest margins rely on forest resources to cope with climate events, among which non-timber forest products (NTFPs) play an important role (Eriksen et al., 2005; Fisher et al., 2010). NTFPs are products of biological origin other than wood derived from forests, other wooded land and trees outside forests (FAO, 2010). They provide food, medicine, livestock fodder and materials for handicrafts and construction among other things and they contribute especially to the livelihoods of poor and disadvantaged people in developing countries by helping to ensure food security, maintaining nutritional balance, meeting medicinal needs and supplying a source of income (FAO, 1995; Shackleton et al., 2002; Marshall and Newton, 2003; Emanuel et al., 2005; Schumann et al., 2010). In particular, people with little formal education and those in poor health turn to NTFP harvesting and use during adverse climatic events (Fisher et al., 2010). Among the plant species providing important NTFPs are indigenous fruit trees (IFTs), which are fruit bearing trees that are locally available, generally ignored by the commercial sector and not well researched. IFTs contribute to the food security of the rural poor, especially in times of famine (Akinnifesi et al., 2008) providing an alternative source of nutrition (Muok et al., 2001) and cash income (Akinnifesi et al., 2006). IFTs often also provide important medicine to local people (Iranbakhsh et al., 2009; Buchmann et al., 2010; Fandohan et al., 2010). Many IFTs improve environmental conditions in the savannah by adding organic matter and nutrients through leaf-fall and by reducing soil temperatures and water loss due to evapotranspiration (e.g., Amundson et al., 1995). Several IFTs also act as an important source of food, water (during times of drought) and shelter for a wide range of animals (e.g. Fenner, 1980). Among the most important indigenous fruit trees in dryland West Africa are the baobab tree (Adansonia digitata), the tamarind tree (Tamarindus indica), the shea nut tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), the African locust bean (Parkia biglobosa), the ber or jujube (Zizyphus mauritiana), the marula tree (Sclerocarya birrea) and the fan palm (Borassus aethyopum) to cite just a few (Boffa, 1999). IFT species are likely to be more resilient to climate change if compared to most of the current crops, which are generally exotic to Africa; IFTs have not lost the genetic capacity to cope with changes as a result of many years of selection. Although IFTs are especially important during droughts and floods - which are predicted to become more common in dryland Africa (i.e. annual mean surface air temperatures are expected to increase 2-4°C by 2099 in West Africa) (Boko et al. in IPCC, 2014) - little is known about the impact of predicted changes in climate on these species’ ecology, phenology (the study of seasonal natural phenomena), fruit production and survival. For example, changes of bloom dates for apple (Malus domestica) and pear (Pyrus communis) cultivars related to climatic changes have been observed in South Africa (Grab and Craparo, 2011). Changes in climate and soil moisture have also been reported to affect the fruiting of several plants in West Africa (Seghieri et al., 2009). Although no studies have determined changes in baobab phenology related to climatic changes, predicted changes in climate are likely to have a negative effect on its distribution across the African continent (Cuni Sanchez et al., 2011). Moreover, one should consider that predicted changes in climate may also accelerate the loss of already declining populations of some of these species through land-use intensification and over-harvesting (e.g. Obiri et al., 2002; Gaoue and Ticktin, 2007; Djossa et al., 2008; Houehanou et al., 2011). In the context of climate change, the maintenance of IFTs is important not only for biodiversity conservation (e.g. the baobab tree is an iconic African tree, being the national tree of Senegal for example) but also for the rural poor, as IFTs provide multiple services and are accessible in times of famine. While some services could be replaced with other techniques (e.g. soil conservation and water conservation techniques related to IFT presence in farmers’ fields), other services are not easily substituted (e.g. IFT edible nutritious fruits are available to be harvested when staple crops fail). Although several studies (e.g. Fisher et al., 2010) have focused on the role of NTFPs and IFTs during climatic stresses (see part (a) in Figure 9.1), little attention has been paid to the broader picture, in which climatic stresses directly impact IFTs and humans, in turn affecting management of IFTs and impacting tree populations (see part (b) in Figure 9.1). Finally, a decreasing number of trees may further impact human management of IFTs for the worse. As long-term monitoring studies of most IFTs (e.g. on population structure, phenology) are not available, local communities are a good source for information not only on management techniques but also on observed changes in climate and impacts on IFTs. Indeed, local communities in rural Africa have been shown to possess valuable knowledge about their environment (e.g. ethnobotany, Assogbadjo et al., 2008; Fandohan et al., 2010, 2011) and vegetation changes (e.g. Wezel and Haigis, 2000). This chapter mainly focuses on the adaptive capacity building loop of the theoretical framework of this book (see Ch. 1, Figure 1.1). It addresses the current local state of the environment, equity and livelihood security, the gap between the existing management practices and opportunities to improve them and adaptive capacity building in rural communities in Benin, paying special attention to IFTs as important NTFPs providers. © 2015 Dominic Stucker and Elena Lopez-Gunn.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136200397; 9780415635936,,,"English","Adaptation to Climate Change through Water Resources Management: Capacity, Equity and Sustainability",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955376285

Yet, while impacts of defoliation on vital rates of adult plants have been well documented, consequences for seed dispersal and seedling recruitment have been barely explored. Here, we assessed the effects of defoliation on fruit production, fruit/seed size, seed dispersal and seedling recruitment in populations of Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii, a tropical rain forest, understorey palm from Mesoamerica, whose leaves are exploited as a highly valuable non-timber forest product (NTFP). Fruit size and seed production were quantified in mature palms that were subjected to 0% (control), 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% experimental removal of standing leaves, applied every 6 months over 2 years. Seed dispersal by birds and gravity, and seed predation by small vertebrates on the ground were also quantified. Rates of seedling recruitment were recorded in non-defoliated and 'sterile' populations (75% sustained defoliation and periodical removal of all produced fruits). Finally, a stochastic model was used to quantify the overall effect of defoliation on seedlings recruited from locally (i.e. dispersed by gravity) and immigrant produced seeds (i.e. dispersed by birds). Increasing defoliation strongly reduced seed production. The probability of bird dispersal was positively correlated with fruit/seed size. Isolated (i.e. bird-dispersed) seeds endured lower predation rates than grouped (i.e. gravity-dispersed) ones. Modelling showed that seedling recruitment rate is severely reduced in highly defoliated populations due to a strong decline in the number of seedlings coming from local seed sources. Surrounding non-defoliated populations could partly compensate for this effect via seedlings coming from immigrant seeds. Synthesis. Chronic and intense defoliation negatively affects seed production and dispersal, which reduces the probability of seedling recruitment. Such effects may have a profound impact on the dynamics and genetic variability of populations, which should be taken into account when considering the effects of natural defoliation and sustainability of leaf-harvesting regimes. Chronic and intense defoliation (right palm drawing) affects negatively seed production in the understorey palm Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii. Seed dispersal by birds compensates seedling recruitment in sterile populations. Persistence of seed sources is critical for the demographic viability and genetic variability of populations under natural and human induced defoliation regimes. © 2014 British Ecological Society.","Chamaedorea ernesti-agustii; Dispersal; Leaf harvesting; Mexico; Non-timber forest products; Plant demography; Plant-animal interaction; Seed fate; Seed predation","anthropogenic effect; defoliation; evergreen tree; experimental study; fruit production; genetic variation; nontimber forest product; population dynamics; rainforest; recruitment (population dynamics); seed dispersal; seed predation; seed size; tropical forest; understory; viability; zoochory; Mexico [North America]; Animalia; Aves; Chamaedorea; Chamaedorea ernesti-augustii; Vertebrata","Martínez-Ramos, M.; Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, Antigua Carretera a Pátzcuaro 8701, Morelia, Michoacán, 58190, Mexico; email: mmartinez@cieco.unam.mx",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00220477,,JECOA,,"English","J.

Along with the liberalization of the perennial tree sector, there are increased fluctuations of cocoa income. At the same time, the demand and interest for timber production and non-wood forest products have also been increasing. With the continuous disappearance of natural forests, the production of these commodities is being shifted into cocoa agroforests and plantations. In view of helping research and development institutions in promoting sustainable tree crop systems, this paper attempts, for the main cocoa producing countries of West Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire), to: (1) document the temporal evolution of the market demand for forests and non-wood forest products both at the local and international levels; (2) explore the set of tree species that can be produced in cocoa agroforests of WCA to satisfy this demand. Deforestation resulting partly from the expansion of perennial orchards and slash and burn agriculture is: (i) leading to a shortage of suitable forest land necessary to stabilize or increase national cocoa production and (ii) increasing the gap between the demand and availability/supply of non-wood forest products (NWFP) and timber by reducing the main source of these products—the forest. Demand of these products is increasing with the growth of urban and peri-urban centers. At the same time, perennial agroforestry systems such as cocoa agroforest are increasingly perceived as assets for Payment for Environmental Services (PES) such as carbon storage and biodiversity conservation, because of the potential of the resources that they can generate. These demands of products and payment for ecosystem services that can be provided by sustainable cocoa agroforestry systems depends upon the appropriate combination of cocoa, timber and non-timber forest trees on the same land. Such demands is still to be properly exploited in the region. Cocoa agroforests in West Africa are characterized by fewer species than those of Central Africa. The level of market access influences the types of species that are managed inside cocoa agroforests. Among the species potentially associable with cocoa, those demanded by the local, regional and international markets are not necessarily the ones that are more frequent in the cocoa fields. The gradual reduction of natural forest, from which timber and non-timber products are gathered, aroused the need to integrate the growing of such species in cocoa agroforestry systems. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Cocoa agroforest; Forest landscape; Market and livelihoods; Payment for environmental services (PES); Timber and non-timber forest products; Value chain; West and Central Africa","agricultural practice; agricultural production; agroforestry; biodiversity; demand analysis; economic analysis; evergreen tree; forestry production; landscape; management practice; market system; nontimber forest product; species diversity; Africa; Theobroma cacao","Sonwa, D.J.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), PO Box 2008, Cameroon",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

These included access to resources and markets, unsustainable extractive activities, demographic pressure, lack of information on market demands, prices, royalties and authorization systems too complex to be applied at the local level. In Central and Eastern Cambodia, participatory approaches were used to interview NTFP collectors in 16 villages in 4 provinces. During focus groups and community meetings, choices and preferences were debated. Herbarium samples of NTFPs that local people consider important were also collected from the forests near each of the villages. The study revealed that information on the location of the villages, population density, ethnic groups, village context (recent situation in terms of infrastructure and private sector investments), and the condition of the forest all need to be taken into account when developing activities to improve NTFP management, uses and trade. A step-by-step approach should include identifying NTFPs as important to the local economy and as the extractive activity with the smallest negative impact on the forest. The study concluded with a recommendation to develop a collectors' network, to plant important and depleted NTFP species, and to develop processed products from NTFP raw materials.","Cambodia; Community forest; Extractive activities; Gender; Non Timber Forest Products; Poverty alleviation; Sustainable use",,"Cirad Upr Bsef, , 34398 Montpellier Cedex 05, France",,,0006579X,,,,"English","Bois Forets Tropiques",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84891055575

Main factors determining the status of the populations of socio-economically important tree species providing those NTFPs are human activities. This study assesses the impact of human population density, land use, and NTFP-harvesting (pruning and debarking) on population structure and fruit production of the socio-economically important tree Lannea microcarpa that is normally conserved by farmers on fields. We compared L. microcarpa stands of protected sites with those of their surrounding communal sites in two differently populated areas in Burkina Faso. Our results reveal an opposed land use impact on the population structure of L. microcarpa in the two areas. In the highly populated area, the species population was more stable in the protected site than in the communal site, while the opposite was observed for the less populated area. Trees of the communal sites bore more fruits than trees of the protected sites. Debarking and pruning had a negative impact on fruit production of the species. We conclude that low intensity of human impact is beneficial for the species and that indirect human impact facilitates fruit production of L. microcarpa. In contrast, in the densely populated area, human impact has reached an intensity that negatively affects the populations of L. microcarpa. While the extent of protecting L. microcarpa on fields still seems to be enough to guarantee the persistence of this important species in the less populated area, it is no longer sufficient in the densely populated area. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Harvesting; Land use; Non-timber forest products; Size class distribution; West African savanna","anthropogenic effect; fruit production; land use; nontimber forest product; persistence; population structure; pruning; savanna; size; tree; Burkina Faso; West Africa","Schumann, K.; Institute of Ecology, Evolution and Diversity, Max-von-Laue-Straße 13, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; email: Schumann@bio.uni-frankfurt.de",,,01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

This region has approximately 24 million inhabitants who use more than 750 million km2 of the anthropic areas intended for agriculture and natural resources for exploitation. The majority of the land use is based on deforestation, shifting cultivation and livestock; alternatives for these uses are crucial to economic development while maintaining environmental conservation. The slash-and-burn practice in smallholdings is losing its sustainability due the increase in land use pressure that reduces the time for rehabilitation during the fallow period. Alternatives have been presented, such as the slash-and-mulch practice. This practice may be promising for environmental quality maintenance, but it has generated economic concerns because it involves mechanisation and the input of nutrients. Another possibility for land use in Brazilian Amazon smallholdings is based on agroforestry systems in which the combination of species at the same site may increase land use efficiency and improve the diversity of products available to farmers. In the last few decades, much attention has been given to the exploitation of non-timber forest products (NTFP). This attention is evidenced by the increasing interest of consumers, as well as industries, for natural products that have as a premise the sustainable development based in the use of natural resources, forest valorisation and the need for conserving the forest ecosystems. The exploitation of NTFP associated with agroforestry systems may be a good option for smallholdings in Brazilian Amazon. However, the NTFP exploitation represents only 0.48% of the Brazilian primary production, a small slice of the national economy. This extractive activity has not been effective for the promotion of both the social and economic development of communities living in the Amazon, and there are many complex reasons to explain its ineffectiveness. Public policies are fundamental to agricultural activities, as well as to livestock and forestry production, to respect the environment and the needs of the communities in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Farmers have developed coping mechanisms, which they deploy at times of climatic shocks. We aimed to analyze the importance of NTFPs in times of drought and to identify options that could increase the capacity to adapt to climate change. We used participatory techniques, livelihood analysis, observations, and measurements to quantify the use of NTFPs. Communities recognized NTFPs as a mechanism to cope with crop failure. We estimated that indigenous fruits contributed to approximately 20% of the energy intake of wealthier farmers and to approximately 40% of the energy intake of poor farmers in years of inadequate rainfall. Farmers needed to invest a considerable share of their time to collect wild fruits from deforested areas. They recognized that the effectiveness of NTFPs as an adaptation option had become threatened by severe deforestation and by illegal harvesting of fruits by urban traders. Farmers indicated the need to plan future land use to (1) intensify crop production, (2) cultivate trees for firewood, (3) keep orchards of indigenous fruit trees, and (4) improve the quality of grazing lands. Farmers were willing to cultivate trees and to organize communal conservation of indigenous fruits trees. Through participatory exercises, farmers elaborated maps, which were used during land use discussions. The process led to prioritization of pressing land use problems and identification of the support needed: fast-growing trees for firewood, inputs for crop production, knowledge on the cultivation of indigenous fruit trees, and clear regulations and compliance with rules for extraction of NTFPs. Important issues that remain to be addressed are best practices for regeneration and conservation, access rules and implementation, and the understanding and management of competing claims on the common lands. Well-managed communal resources can provide a strong tool to maintain and increase the rural communities' ability to cope with an increasingly variable climate. © 2013 by the author(s).","Adaptation strategies; Livelihood analysis; NTFP; Resource conservation","adaptive management; climate change; climate variation; common land; common property resource; conservation management; coping strategy; cultivation; drought; nontimber forest product; prioritization; rural society; smallholder; woodland; Zimbabwe","Woittiez, L.

Lianas are important components of tropical forests and also non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In this study we 1) record the species of lianas exploited by indigenous Kaingang people and their availability in the remnant forest patches around the city of Porto Alegre, Southern Brazil, 2) describe the harvesting and crafting techniques, and 3) estimate the amount of lianas sold as handicrafts in the main local market and the income obtained. Lianas are exploited exclusively for the handicrafts trade. Seven liana species, out of 31 found in forest remnants, are used by Kaingangs. Two of them account for 90% of all handicrafts sold and 40.5% of all liana stems in secondary growth remnants-Forsteronia glabrescens Müll.Arg. and Amphilophium paniculatum (L.) Kunth. Another three species are scarce and are exploited less. Raw material must be used within a few weeks and be continuously harvested. Kaingang harvesting strategy includes mechanisms to avoid overexploitation: the division of exploitation areas into plots that are left to rest for one year before a new harvesting campaign, and the family's control of information about potential harvesting sites. The entire process, from collection to sale, is carried out by the Kaingang families without intermediaries, contrary to the most common pattern of NTFP market chains. Trading occurs only locally. Each family earns from USD 98.15 to USD 371.12 per month (30% to 115% of the minimum Brazilian salary). In one year each family consumed on average 10,328.40 meters of lianas in the manufacture of handicrafts for sale in the major fair in the city, which represents about 50% of the demand for lianas. We estimated that one hectare of unexploited forest can have on average a standing crop of 10,165.40 m of the most desired species. Market pressure regulates exploitation, a common pattern in NTFP use, but in this case leading to a mix of usually opposite trends-manufacture with increasingly sophisticated techniques, but using a few liana species and an increasing number of alternative materials. © 2013 The New York Botanical Garden.","exploitation; extractivism; handicrafts; harvesting; indigenous people; Lianas; non-timber forest products; traditional uses; vines","Amphilophium paniculatum; Forsteronia","Guadagnin, D.

This study identified, quantified, and evaluated the economic importance of the medicinal plant trade in Sierra Leone so that recommendations for conservation could be made. We carried out a quantitative market survey. We interviewed 120 vendors in three major cities and all vendors in two towns near a national park. Apart from the semistructured interviews, specimen samples were collected and identified, prices noted, and sales units measured. More than 40 species were traded in urban markets, nine species being the most frequently traded in all three cities. Only two plants were traded in the towns: Xylopia aethiopica (Dunal) A.Rich.and Garcinia kola Heckel. Most plants were traded in the form of dried bark or leaves. It was estimated that at least USD 64,000 are being annually traded in informal markets in major cities, the nine species most frequently traded contributing most of the retail value. Little information was found on import/export figures. Results from this study indicate that the trade of certain medicinal plants could be promoted as an alternative livelihood strategy for edge communities of protected areas.

One key aspect is that the magnitude of conflict of use can be location specific, thus adding complexity to policy development. This paper focuses on the extent to which the potential for conflict of use in multipurpose tree species varies across the Amazonian lowland forests shared by Peru, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela, emphasizing the economic dimension of conflict. Based on a review of the current normative and regulatory aspects of timber and NTFP extraction in the five countries, the paper also briefly discusses the opportunities and constraints for harmonization of timber and NTFP management of multipurpose species across the region. It was found that about half of the 336 timber species reviewed across the five countries also have non-timber uses. Eleven timber species are multipurpose in all five countries: Calophyllum brasiliense, Cedrela odorata, Ceiba pentandra, Clarisia racemosa, Ficus insipida, Jacaranda copaia, Schefflera morototoni, Simarouba amara and Terminalia amazonia. Seven other multipurpose species occurred only in either Venezuela (. Tabebuia impetiginosa, Spondias mombin, Pentaclethra macroloba, Copaifera officinalis, Chlorophora tinctoria, Carapa guianensis) or Ecuador (. Tabebuia chrysantha). Four multipurpose tree species presented the highest potential of conflict of use across the region: Dipteryx odorata, Tabebuia serratifolia, Hymenaea courbaril and Myroxylon balsamum yet these were not evenly distributed across all five countries. None of the five studied countries have specific legislation to promote sustainable use of any of the multipurpose species reported here and thus mitigate potential conflict of use; nor documented management options for integration or else segregation of both their timber and NTFP values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Amazonia; Conflict of use; Multiple forest management; Multipurpose forest trees; Non-timber forest products; Timber; Tropical forests","deciduous forest; forest management; forestry policy; nontimber forest product; policy development; sustainability; timber harvesting; tropical forest; article; Bolivia; Colombia; conflict; economic aspect; Ecuador; human; law; Peru; tree; tropical rain forest; Venezuela; Amazonia; Bolivia; Colombia; Ecuador; Peru; Venezuela; Amazonia; Conflict of use; Multiple forest management; Multipurpose forest trees; Non-timber forest products; Timber; Tropical forests; Bolivia; Colombia; Conflict (Psychology); Ecuador; Forestry; Geography; Peru; Trees; Venezuela","Herrero-Jáuregui, C.; Departamento de Ecología, , 28040 Madrid, Spain; email: crherrero@bio.ucm.es",,,03014797,,JEVMA,"24061084","English","J.

The interest in NWFPs as alternative products in the forest sector has increased drastically throughout the world over the last decade. However, in many countries, the maximal commercial contribution of NWFPs has not yet been achieved. In addition to series of economic, social and environmental benefits to society, special emphasis was put on NWFP importance to local communities which rely on NWFPs as the only source of subsistence. The territory of the Serbian Northern Province is characterised by an exceptional richness in wild flora and fauna.

The aim of this study was to identify the flows of the purchase of raw NWFPs and the sale of final products on the research area in Vojvodina. A hypothetical starting point was that an increase is present in the domestic sale of NWFPs. The purpose of the study was to assess the compatibility of the local and the global markets, with a drastic increase in the marketability of NWFPs as the derivatives of organic production. The subject of the study were the enterprises dealing with NWFPs purchase, processing and sale, purchased quantities of raw products, and the contingents of final products realised on the domestic and foreign markets. The applied methodology was based on the dynamic analysis and statistical methods by which the variations in purchased and sold quantities in the past period are defined and the future trend projects are devised. © 2014 Lietuvos Misku Institutas.

However, profits generated from IHCs for rural smallholders in these areas are still very low. A survey was conducted in 10 villages in Ségou and Koulikoro regions, Mali, in order to assess the current status of IHCs on villager's livelihood and the potential of IHCs for rural smallholders. In total, 34 species of vegetables and herbs, and 43 NTFP species were listed as crops which are highly appreciated for various purposes including food, beverages, medicine and cosmetics. Most NTFPs have multiple uses depending on the parts utilized. Access to germplasm was relatively easy since seed harvesting and collection is the common way in villages. Diversity, versatility and accessibility play a key role in the villagers' livelihood, while low and variable productivity, caused by their phenological traits and inappropriate management practices, limit the participation of IHCs in the market. Besides that, market expansion is limited due to the lack of processing/preservation techniques and facilities. Since smallholder farmers have limited access to finance, introducing a micro-finance system and/or setting up an organization of producers may strengthen market competitiveness. To support IHCs, there is a need to apply comprehensive countermeasures along the whole value chain.","Natural resources; Non timber forest products; Rural development",,,,"International Society for Horticultural Science",05677572,9789066056565,,,"English","Acta Hortic.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84887132262

There is, however, very little data at the household-level concerning the economic contribution of NTFPs to mountain villager livelihoods. This study uses village-level and household-level data collected from nine mountain villages in Gangwon and North Gyeongsang provinces to (1) reveal the economic contribution of NTFPs to mountain villager livelihoods and (2) analyse the reasons for differing degrees of household reliance on NTFPs. Data show that the mean contribution of NTFPs to households is 4.85% of household revenue. However, clustering households by share of NTFP revenue shows that the mean contribution of NTFPs for the tertile of households with the highest share of NTFP revenue is 21.53% of household revenue. Data suggest a positive correlation between household revenue and NTFP revenue. Poorer households are the most reliant on NTFPs and tend to generate the majority of their NTFP revenue from cultivated NTFPs. A discrete choice model informed by the sustainable livelihoods framework and estimated using a multinomial logit regression suggests that contextual factors and institutions have a stronger effect on a household's degree of reliance on NTFPs than assets. Findings suggest that policies supporting NTFP commercialisation should actively target poorer households and take into account each village's contextual factors and institutions. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","capital resources; development; economic analysis; environmental income; household economy; income generation; NTFP","commercialization; discrete choice analysis; economic analysis; economic impact; forestry production; household income; income distribution; logit analysis; nontimber forest product; regression analysis; village; South Korea","Van Gevelt, T.; Centre of Development Studies, 7 West Road, Cambridge, CB3 9DT, United Kingdom; email: tav22@cam.ac.uk",,,14728028,,FTLOA,,"English","For.

In this paper, we assessed the ecological response of an NTFP producing plant-cipó-preto (roots of Philodendron corcovadense Kunth)-to harvesting by a local community in the south of Brazil. Our findings showed a strong impact of harvesting on root size as a consequence of excessive and long-term harvesting, which may trigger impacts on the population dynamics and on the biology of the plant. These findings also contradict local perceptions regarding the sustainability of their harvesting practices.

Focusing on the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (formerly known as the North-West Frontier Province or NWFP), the paper first investigates long-run data at the district level beginning 1902. Results show that the population of livestock, the major asset of rural households, experienced a persistent decline after crop shocks due to droughts, but did not respond much to the Great Depression. In the post-independence period, crop agriculture continued to be vulnerable to natural disasters, although less substantially so, while the response of livestock to such shocks was indiscernible from district-level data. To examine microeconomic mechanisms underlying such asset dynamics, I analyze a panel dataset collected from approximately 300 households in three villages in the NWFP during the late 1990s. Results show that the dynamics of household landholding and livestock are associated with a single long-run equilibrium. When human capital is included, the dynamics curve changes its shape but this is not sufficiently nonlinear to produce statistically significant multiple equilibriums. The size of livestock holding was reduced in all villages hit by macroeconomic stagnation, while land depletion was reported only in a village with inferior access to markets. The patterns of asset dynamics established from historical and contemporary analyses are consistent with limited but improving access to consumption smoothing measures in the study region over the century. © 2013 Asian Development Bank and Asian Development Bank Institute.","Asset dynamics; Buffer stock; Natural disaster; Pakistan; Poverty trap","data set; economic development; human capital; landholding; livestock; low income population; microeconomics; natural disaster; panel data; poverty; rural area; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan","Kurosaki, T.; Institute of Economic Research, Japan",,,01161105,,,,"English","Asian Dev.

Particularly in low-income countries, nontimber forest product (NTFP) extraction by rural people, which provides important resources and income to the rural poor, contributes to the level and pattern of forest degradation. Although recent policy, particularly in Africa, emphasizes forest degradation, relatively little research describes the spatial aspects of NTFP collection that lead to spatial degradation patterns. This paper reviews both the spatial empirical work on NTFP extraction and related forest degradation patterns, and spatial models of behavior of rural people who extract NTFPs from forest. Despite the impact of rural people's behavior on resulting quantities and patterns of forest resources, spatial-temporal models/patterns rarely inform park siting and sizing decisions, econometric assessments of park effectiveness, development projects to support conservation, or REDD protocols.

Its genesis can be attributed to the society's concern for the social and environmental significance of forests. Forest management certification when coupled with the chain-of-custody certification; then, the supply chain stages for such forest products can carry an ecolabel. Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are of socio-economic and cultural importance for the forest dwelling communities, particularly for the tropical countries like India. India is home to an amazing diversity of plants, with over 46,000 plant species recorded to occur there. NTFP's availability, utilization, commercialization, exploitation, management practices, policies and tenure systems in different parts of India have high diversity and variability. There is concern, however, that collection methods for most of NTFP species are destructive and wild populations are declining as a result. Thus, the harvest of NTFPs is coming under increasing scrutiny from certification programmes, as it plays a key role in the sustainable management of forest resources and community benefit worldwide.

This paper applies a choice experiment approach to evaluate policy options that are hypothesised to provide incentives for small scale forest actors to comply with the forestry law governing trade in NTFP in Cameroon. Data was collected from 70 traders. Based on willingness to pay measures, it was revealed that the options most preferred by the sampled traders included a decentralisation of the application process to obtain permits and a reduction in the volume of paper work involved in the process. The authors conclude that acknowledging the preferences of small scale actors can be relevant in reducing illegality in the forestry sector.","choice experiments; forest law compliance; forest law design; policy option; stakeholder participation","forestry policy; harvesting; law enforcement; logging (timber); nontimber forest product; preference behavior; stakeholder; timber trade; willingness to pay; Cameroon; Congo Basin","Ghent University, Belgium",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

For two centuries large quantities of non-timber candelilla (Euphorbia antisyphilitica Zucc., Euphorbiaceae) have been harvested from wild populations in northern Mexico. The wax that candelilla produces is used for various purposes by many different types of industries. Although extraction is regulated by the government, lack of ecological information has led to concern for overexploitation and population decreases. In the arid region of Cuatrocienegas, Coahuila, Mexico, we measured growth and reproduction in candelilla populations with variable harvest rates. Interviews were used to determine how harvest criteria and volume relate to plant performance and to learn about current extraction policies. We found the average annual harvest to be high (8,273.02 ± 2,076.09 kg/per person/per year) but the population size to be consistent (9,278 to 73,250 individuals/ha). Initial number of stems and height per plant at first census, time elapsed since last harvest, as well as seasonal changes affected individual plant performance. Relative growth rate (TR) was higher but also more variable among small plants relative to larger plants, making them more vulnerable to harvest effects. TR and fecundity rates are negatively affected when less than two years elapsed between harvests. Nowadays, although fewer local people work in candelilla extraction, those from the lowest socioeconomic brackets depend on it most. The incorporation of the ecological information obtained here into Mexican law will ensure better management of this NTFP resource. Also, improving the techniques of wax extraction and promoting fair trade to increase the price paid to producers could reduce the negative impacts on plant performance and ensure sustainable use of natural populations. © 2013 The New York Botanical Garden.","Candelilla; Euphorbiaceae; Extraction; Harvest intensity; Non-timber product; Relative growth rate; Wax","Euphorbia; Euphorbia antisyphilitica; Euphorbiaceae","Mandujano, M.

However, the potential of NTFPs to contribute to development remained limited and open to doubt. The study objectives were to: (i) analyze the role of NTFPs livelihood strategies in rural development in order to explain their potentials and failures; and (ii) identify and analyze the factors influencing the contribution of NTFPs livelihood strategies to household income. The study was carried out analyzing three NTFPs in Rashad locality in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan in 2008–2009. The data were collected through interviews, direct observations and market surveys. Purposive sampling technique was applied to select 221 and 62 collector and trader households, respectively. The results revealed that Adansonia digitata fruit sale represents a subsistence strategy for some sampled households and accumulative strategy for others, while Ziziphus spina-christi and Balanites aegyptiaca fruits sale is a subsistence strategy for all the surveyed households. The study results also showed that the income from selling the fruits was positively and negatively influenced by different external and internal factors. The study concluded that any assumption regarding the potential of NTFPs to positively affect rural development depends on their role in an accumulative strategy that lifts people out of poverty. Institutional, technical and financial supports are necessary to influence the future direction of the NTFP contribution toward accumulative strategy. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Capital accumulation; Expenditure; Income generation; Livelihood strategies; NTFPs; Sudan","Adansonia digitata; Balanites aegyptiaca; Ziziphus spina-christi","Pettenella, D.; Dipartimento Territorio e Sistemi Agro-Forestali, Italy",,"Elsevier Ltd",0308521X,,AGSYD,,"English","Agric.

Globalization of herbal medicine along with uncontrolled exploitative practices and lack of concerted conservation efforts, have pushed many of Nepal's medicinal plants to the verge of extinction. Sustainable utilization and management of medicinal plants, based on traditional knowledge, is therefore necessary.Methods: After establishing verbal informed consent with participating communities, five field surveys, roughly 20 days in duration, were carried out. In all, 176 schedules were surveyed, and 52 participants were consulted through focus group discussions and informal meetings. Altogether, 24 key informants were surveyed to verify and validate the data. A total of 252 individuals, representing non-timber forest product (NTFP) collectors, cultivators, traders, traditional healers (Baidhya), community members, etc. participated in study. Medicinal plants were free-listed and their vernacular names and folk uses were collected, recorded, and applied to assess agreement among respondents about traditional medicines, markets and management.Results: Within the study area, medicinal herbs were the main ingredients of traditional therapies, and they were considered a main lifeline and frequently were the first choice. About 55% plants were ethnomedicinal, and about 37% of ethnomedicinal plants possessed the highest informant consensus value (0.86-1.00). Use of Cordyceps sinensis as an aphrodisiac, Berberis asiatica for eye problems, Bergenia ciliata for disintegration of calculi, Sapindus mukorossi for dandruff, and Zanthoxylum armatum for toothache were the most frequently mentioned. These species possess potential for pharmacology.Conclusion: Medicinal plants are inseparable from local livelihoods because they have long been collected, consumed, and managed through local customs and knowledge. Management of traditional therapies is urged, because the therapies are empirically and knowledge based, often culturally inherited and important to pharmacology and local livelihoods. However, traditional therapies are currently being eroded due to changing lifestyles, perceptions, social transformations, and acculturation. © 2013 Kunwar et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Baidhya; Baitadi district; Indigenous use; Medicinal plants; Nepal; Sustainable management","article; growth, development and aging; marketing; medicinal plant; Nepal; traditional medicine; Marketing; Medicine, Traditional; Nepal; Plants, Medicinal","Kunwar, R.M.; Center for Biological Conservation, Kathmandu, Nepal; email: ripukunwar@gmail.com",,,17464269,,,"23587109","English","J.

In addition to its high economic value, pine resin also has bright domestic and international market prospects. Utilization of commercial pine resin has been carried out in Indonesia, but the forest road network required for extracting pine resin has not been specifically planned. To date, the planning and selection of forest road network in forest management in Indonesia are intended only for the extraction of timber products and have not been integrated with the use of NTFPs; also, they have not considered the economic, ecological, and social aspects a whole. Planning and selection of forest road network have focused more on economic aspects only. This study aimed at planning and assessing the forest road network for extracting pine resin by considering the economic, ecological, and social criteria. Decision-making method used to select the best forest road network was utility analysis. Indicator used included road length, road density, a correction factor for manual carrying of pine resin, pine resin carrying distance, road construction cost, and productivity of carrying and extracting pine resin. The result of the utility analysis indicates that an alternative of forest road network for extracting pine resin has no the whole best indicators, but it has the highest utility value. This study suggested that the use of the utility analysis help the decision makers to selects process for forest road network alternative easily and rapidly. © 2013 Institut Pertanian Bogor, Department of Forest Management, Faculty of Forestry.

Yet, there is a paucity of information on the distribution, population status and sustainable management of NTFPs in most of the tropical lowland rainforests. We, therefore, assessed the population, distribution and threats to sustainable management of NTFPs within the tropical lowland rainforests of Omo and Shasha Forest Reserves, south western Nigeria. Data were obtained through inventory surveys on five top priority species including: bush mango (Irvingia gabonensis (Aubry-Lecomte ex O'Rorke) Baill), African walnut (Tetracarpidium conophorum (Mull. Arg.) Hutch. & Dalziel syn. Plukenetia conophora), chew-stick (Massularia acuminata (G. Don) Bullock), fever bark (Annickia chlorantha Setten & P. J. Maas syn. Enantia chloranta) and bush pepper (Piper guineense Schumach. & Thonn.). Purposive and stratified random sampling techniques were used for the inventory. Each forest reserve was stratified into three, viz: less disturbed natural forest (for areas that have been rested for at least ten years), recently disturbed natural forest (for areas that have suffered one form of human perturbation or the other in the last five years), and plantation forest (for areas carrying forest plantation). Data were collected from eighteen 10 m × 500 m belt transects located in the above strata. The species were generally fewer in both plantation and recently disturbed natural forest than the less disturbed natural forest, suggesting that forest disturbances (habitat modification) for other uses may have an effect on the occurrence and densities of the NTFPs. Exceptions to this trend were found for P. guineense and T. conophorum, which were fairly common in both plantation and recently disturbed natural forest. Among three tree NTFP species (i. e. I. gabonensis, M. acuminata and A. chlorantha), only I. gabonensis showed a significant difference in overall DBH size classes for both reserves (t=-2. 404; df =21; p=0. 026). Three tree NTFP species in both reserves further showed differences from the regular patterns of distribution of trees. The fairly regular reverse J-shaped size class distribution observed for M. acuminata in the study sites, however, suggests a recuperating population. In general, destructive harvesting of species, logging operations, low population size, narrow distribution ranges and habitat degradation are the major threats to the population of NTFPs in the study area. The implications of our findings for sustainable management of NTFPs in the study area are discussed and recommendations are made for a feasible approach towards enhancing the status of the species. © 2013 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","distribution; forest management; non-timber forest products (NTFP); population density; Tropical rainforest","environmental disturbance; forest management; habitat fragmentation; nature reserve; nontimber forest product; plantation; population distribution; rainforest; sustainable forestry; Nigeria; Annickia chlorantha; Enantia; Irvingia gabonensis; Juglans; Massularia acuminata; Piper guineense; Plukenetia; Tetracarpidium conophorum","Jimoh, S.

Recently, demands for baobab fruit derivatives on the global organic market, namely pulp and seed oil, have increased rapidly, leading to concerns that this may have negative impacts on subsistence users, particularly in areas where there is an existing high dependence on these products, such as West Africa. In contrast, in southern Africa baobab fruit are probably 'underutilized' and commercialization would help reduce poverty. This study evaluated the direct-use (subsistence) and income (cash) value of baobab fruit on the livelihoods of baobab fruit harvesters in South Africa. Harvesters were mostly women (98 %), many of whom were unemployed (98 %) and uneducated (70 %). The majority (68 %) received social grants and were involved in informal occupations (55 %), which contributed 35 and 18 % to total annual income respectively. The trade and direct-use value of non-timber forest products contributed 14 and 33 % to annual income, of which, baobab fruit made up 38 and 4 % respectively. Baobab fruit was the only non-timber forest product that had a higher income value (4×) than direct-use value. Cash earned was used to buy food (73 %) and invest in small businesses, suggesting a move from subsistence to cash economy. It is suggested that commercialization of baobab fruit will have far-reaching benefits; and that secured access to trees and investment in local beneficiation will further increase the value of the resource for many marginalized people in southern Africa. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Subsistence use; Venda; Women","bark; commercialization; dicotyledon; fruit; harvesting; income distribution; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; subsistence; vegetable oil; womens employment; womens status; Limpopo; South Africa; Venda; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata","Venter, S.

Despite the threats to seasonally dry tropical ecosystems, little is known about the impact of human land use change on their conservation value. We used savanna woodlands within the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot as a case study to understand the effects of human land use on plant diversity. We investigated the effects of three common land-use activities - biomass extraction, livestock grazing and ground fire - on species richness and diversity, as well as species composition in terms of the breadth of geographic ranges of species present. We found that total species richness increased with livestock grazing due to increased understory richness. Overstory diversity and tree sapling diversity and richness decreased with more recent fire. Greater canopy openness was associated with increased understory richness and reduced overstory richness. The combination of fire and livestock grazing are likely to increase canopy openness, leading to a shift in diversity from the overstory to the understory. Although we found no change in species richness or diversity with biomass extraction, areas with biomass extraction had more widely distributed species and fewer narrowly distributed species, indicating land use may lead to biotic homogenization.

Results from a thematic synthesis of literature germane to harvesters and forest managers indicate that many NTFPs have considerable markets but most are inadequately monitored, economically underregulated, and ecologically poorly understood. The people who harvest wild-grown NTFPs are often referred to as wildcrafters. Literature suggests that wildcrafters have historically been marginalized and are often reticent to share information or to participate in government-led initiatives. Additionally, forest managers and wildcrafters often are unable or unwilling to work together. Social networking has been suggested as a way to improve collaboration between the two stakeholders. Some examples of successful networks exist, but norms and priorities may inhibit greater participation. Asynchronous communication via the Internet and other wireless technology could improve the situation. Developing systematic inventory systems, designing NTFP output reporting protocols, advancing forest farming, and improving access to information on NTFP markets, policies, and practices may also be useful. The need for improvement on all fronts is increasingly relevant because of growing demand for NTFPs.

A review of the reported amounts of NWFP from the forest department during the past 10 years is made and were followed trade flows by statistic information from the United Nations (UN Comtrade) and Bulgaria's participation in them. Over the years different NWFP had different priority, depending on the needs of society and of individual consumers. In the work NWFP are divided into four groups: Food and medicinal products; Raw materials for industrial processing; Fodder, grazing and beekeeping; and Others. During the last years were collected and traded nuts, berries, rosehips, lime blossom, herbs and barks. Bulgaria ranks eighth among exporters of herbs with the average quantity exported in 2003-2006 from 10 350 t and 9213 t in 2007-2011. An export of herbs from Bulgaria is pointed to more than 50 countries of the world. European Union countries buy about 88% of them. The most important non-European country in which Bulgaria exported herbs are USA and the most important destination of herbs export for Bulgaria is Germany (about 50% to two-thirds). Besides herbs, the objects of international trade are nuts, lime blossom, European smoke-tree, etc. Bulgaria is among the leading countries in the export of fresh mushrooms in Eastern Europe and is third/fourth place after Romania, Serbia and Greece. Wild mushrooms occupy an important place in the country's export list. Production and trading of balsamic resin, kindling and vegetable tannins decrease. Among NWFP collected from forest areas, with economic importance are: medicinal plants, berries, lime blossom, bark, wild mushrooms, etc. It is noted that in the production of Christmas trees, ornamental plants, vegetable tannins and honey also has an interest. The brief overview and analysis of trade in NWFP in domestic and international market makes it possible to conclude that these products are essential to the economy and livelihood of the majority of the Bulgarian population.","Harmonized description and coding system catalog (HS); Non-wood forest products (NWFP)",,"Stoyanova, M.; Forest Research InstituteBulgaria",,"Bulgarian Academy of Sciences",13118706,,,,"English","Silva Balcanica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907177585

Although regional conservation ef orts such as the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) focus primarily on public lands, all land ownerships and allocations contribute unique benef ts over the regional landscape that need to be considered as context for federal land management. In addition, whereas the NWFP emphasizes older forest and associated species, an ecosystem and multi-species management approach encompasses the full sequence of forest development. Recent results from NWFP Ef ectiveness Monitoring for late-successional and old-growth forest provide detailed maps of forest composition and structure over all ownerships, and for all stages of forest development, including trends over the NWFP period (1994 to present). More than two-thirds of older forest (overstory conifers >20 inches [50.8 cm]) was federally owned, whereas most early-seral forest was on nonfederal lands. However, early-seral stands have developed primarily following timber harvest and lacked the structural diversity typical of natural stands. Over the NWFP period, harvesting removed about 13 percent (491,000 acres [198,700 ha]) of older forest on nonfederal lands, whereas the loss of older forest from federal lands (about 200,000 acres [80,937 ha]) was attributed primarily to wildf re. Overall, the monitoring data suggest there was a slight net loss of older forest on federal lands since the beginning of the NWFP, so losses of older forest to wildf re apparently were roughly balanced by recruitment. However, recruitment was most likely through incremental stand growth over the 20-inch [50-cm] threshold, or from understory disturbances (including thinning) that eliminated smaller-diameter trees and increased average stand diameter, rather than from increases in stands of much larger and older trees. Land ownerships and allocations also were unevenly distributed across regional environmental gradients. Federal forests generally occupied higher elevations and lower-productivity sites, and a substantial portion of most of the mid- to high-elevation forest types were contained within reserves and managed for conservation objectives. In contrast, several forest types, such as oak woodlands, occurred predominantly at low elevations on nonfederal lands where they are managed for a variety of objectives, and are not well-represented in reserves. I will discuss potential implications of the monitoring results for stand-level management and for the conservation of older forests and associated species across the region.","Change detection; Conservation planning; Early-successional forest; Forest monitoring; Late-successional forest; Northwest forest plan; Old growth; Pacif c northwest","conservation management; conservation planning; environmental gradient; federal system; landownership; management practice; old-growth forest; recruitment (population dynamics); stand structure; succession; wildfire; Pacific Northwest","Ohmann, J.

This paper describes these nurseries, their role in cactus conservation, and the benefits and limitations for the people managing them. The nurseries have helped decrease illegal traffic in cacti and have enabled ex situ conservation of 22 cacti species. Cactus management has changed from extraction to cultivation, as a result of the knowledge and actions of multiple actors. The main limitation is marketing, a recurring problem for non-timber forest products (NTFP). Greater coordination among stakeholders is recommended, such as involvement by non-governmental organizations to improve their probability of success, as well as learning from the experience of other cactus UMAs.

To the extent that these goals affect processes or species populations that span landscapes, their cumulative impacts can only be assessed if landscape-wide patterns of thinning are monitored. This is particularly relevant when policy or management patterns change abruptly for large land ownerships, as was intended with the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in 1994. Satellite images provide consistent views of large landscapes and thus have the potential to monitor forest harvest, but these have typically focused only on stand-replacing harvest. In the Pacific Northwest, imagery from the Landsat family of satellites has long been used to quantify such harvest (Cohen et al. 2002), to estimate its impacts on carbon flux (Cohen et al. 1996), and to evaluate its potential impacts on critical habitat (Healey et al. 2008). Mapping partial harvest, however, is more challenging. If the approximate location of such harvest is known, the mathematical signal of partial harvest is discernible in the signal of the imagery (Healey et al. 2006), but the challenge is separating that relatively subtle signal from background noise. Recent improvements in data access, computing power, and algorithms, however, have led to more robust mapping of partial harvest. T e US Geological Survey recently opened the Landsat data archive to free access (Woodcock et al. 2008), and also simplifed its delivery of the imagery, making management of large data sets practical. Combined with new algorithms that tap this archive (Kennedy et al. 2010), separation of partial harvest from background noise is now both mathematically and logistically tractable (f g. 1). In support of the effectiveness monitoring for the NWFP (http://www.reo.gov/monitoring/), we developed yearly maps of forest disturbance, including partial harvest, for the entire NWFP area for the period from 1985 to 2007 (Kennedy et al. 2012). These maps are available in digital form at http://landtrendr.forestry.oregonstate.edu/content/download-data. For the purposes of evaluating partial harvest patterns, these data provide information on the estimated magnitude of vegetation removal occurring in each 30-m cell in the map. These magnitude quantities are satellite-based ref ections of reality and thus are not strictly biophysical quantities that equate precisely with proportional basal-area removal or other similar quantities familiar to silviculturists. In particular, the quantities are expected to have different biophysical meaning in different forest types (e.g., Douglas-fir vs. Lodgepole Pine [Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus contorta]). Nevertheless, within a given forest type and region, they have utility to distinguish among harvests of different severities. Grouping these data into relative intensity classes of high, medium, and low, and separating by ownership, temporal trends in harvest practice over time can be documented. In the Cascades province of the NWFP in Oregon, for example (fig. 2), overall area harvest fell after court injunctions in the early 1990s, and the harvest intensity since then has been focused on lower-intensity harvest types. Private lands, on the other hand, saw an eventual rise in harvest rate, with an increasing proportion of that harvest being high-intensity harvest. Similar summaries can be replicated over the entire NWFP area.","Northwest forest plan; Satellite mapping; Tinning","algorithm; forest management; forestry policy; landownership; Landsat; policy implementation; satellite imagery; silviculture; thinning; timber harvesting; trend analysis; Pacific Northwest",,,"USDA Forest Service",08874840,,,,"English","USDA For.

Harvest of these species often is assumed to be sustainable due to their commonness. However, because of the ecological roles of common species, harvest may affect and be affected by ecological interactions at broader scales, which are rarely considered when evaluating the sustainability of harvest. We use a case study of the mountain date palm (Phoenix loureiroi Kunth), harvested in South India to produce brooms, to present a conceptual framework illustrating how intensive harvest of a common species interacts with other anthropogenic management practices, plant-animal interactions and surrounding environmental conditions. Methods: We apply this framework to understanding the impacts of mountain date palm harvest in the southern Western Ghats regions of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. We integrate data on the extent and levels of commercial harvest, local management practices, the ecological context in which harvest occurs, and research on harvest effects. We use this information to document the intensity and extent of mountain date palm harvest in the study area, identify the ecological implications of harvest, and demonstrate how a framework that considers harvest in the context of ecological communities and ecosystems is important for assessing the impacts of harvest of common NTFP species. Results: We show that mountain date palm leaves are heavily harvested from natural areas in the southern Western Ghats but that harvest levels have declined in recent years. Mountain date palm management and harvest occur within a network of ecological interactions, linking human activities to population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes. We demonstrate that understanding the effects of return interval of anthropogenic fire, herbivory by wild animals and livestock, as well as the light environment in which harvest occurs are critical to assessing the sustainability of mountain date palm harvest. Conclusions: By considering mountain date palm leaf harvest in the context of ecological interactions at multiple scales, our findings show that sustainability cannot be assessed only from a population-level perspective. This general framework highlights the need to incorporate ecosystem-and community-level properties and processes more frequently into assessments of the sustainability of NTFP harvest-especially for widespread and common species-to ensure that their important economic and ecological roles are maintained. © 2013 Mandle et al.; licensee Springer.","Fire; Herbivory; Non-timber forest product (NTFP); Plant-animal interactions; Resource management; Savanna woodland; Western Ghats","Animals; Fires; Forestry; Harvesting; Information management; Landforms; Plants (botany); Sustainable development; Timber; Herbivory; Non-timber forest products; Resource management; Savanna woodland; Western ghats; Ecosystems; conceptual framework; ecosystem dynamics; environmental impact assessment; fire management; forest management; harvesting; herbivory; human activity; nontimber forest product; plant-herbivore interaction; population ecology; savanna; sustainability; woodland; India; Karnataka; Tamil Nadu; Western Ghats; Animalia; Phoenix dactylifera","Mandle, L.; Botany Department, , Manoa, HI, United States; email: lisa.mandle@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",21921709,,,,"English","Ecol.

Nonetheless, their deforestation and conversion to croplands is intensifying. Expected higher financial return from crop production is a main driver of conversion, but research supporting this underlying claim is scarce. We compared the financial returns for two crop production options (sesame and cotton) and forest use, in a dry forest area known for its frankincense production in northern Ethiopia. Net revenue was highest for sesame and lowest for cotton agricultural use. The forest based revenue was intermediate. The revenues from the crop production options were more sensitive to a range of uncertainties than the forest land use. Our results show that forest land use that includes commercial NTFPs is financially competitive to some commercial crop options and offers returns of better reliability. The hypothesis that forest based revenues are lower than crop based ones is not supported by our results. Therefore, the continued deforestation of dry forests cannot be explained by lower returns alone, but other factors such as awareness, market access, property right and institutional issues may also play a role to drive deforestation and conversion of dry forests to croplands. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Deforestation; Economic analysis; Land use option; Metema; Net revenue","agricultural land; crop production; deforestation; dry forest; economic analysis; forest management; land use change; nontimber forest product; uncertainty analysis; woodland; Ethiopia; Metema; Acacia senegal; Boswellia; Boswellia sacra; Gossypium hirsutum; Sesamum indicum","Lemenih, M.; International Water Management Institute (IWMI), P.O.

We assessed the socio-economic status and natural resource use of 3 villages bordering Mawambi Hills, an unprotected forest in southwest Cameroon, home to both the Critically Endangered Cross River gorilla Gorilla gorilla diehli and the Endangered Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee Pan troglodytes ellioti. This forest likely hosts one of the largest sub-populations of Cross River gorillas in Cameroon and is vulnerable to human influence given that it lies in close proximity to surrounding villages and is less hilly than other Cross River gorilla habitats. We show that employment opportunities in surrounding villages are rare, and people rely on agriculture and the collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), such as eru Gnetum spp. and bush mango Irvingia spp., for food and income. We also show that areas of heavy human activity coincide spatially with great ape nest sites and raise concerns about the potential impact of human activities on great ape survival at the site. We call for (1) sustainable harvesting and marketing of NTFPs, (2) the introduction of alternative livelihood opportunities (e.g. beekeeping and on-farm production of NTFPs), (3) active wildlife law enforcement to safeguard the persistence of great apes, and (4) the introduction of a community-based forest management programme that will enable communities to secure the rights to use and manage surrounding forest resources legally. © Inter-Research 2013.","Chimpanzee; Cross river gorilla; Forest management; Gnetum spp; Irvingia spp; Non-timber forest products; Non-wood forest products; NTFP",,"Etiendem, D.N.; Human Ecology Department, Laarbeeklaan 103, Belgium",,"Inter-Research",18635407,,,,"English","Endanger.

(Pequi) in the Brazilian Savanna, Northeastern Brazil Caryocar coriaceum Wittm. (pequi) is a tree native to northeastern Brazil that produces fruits of importance to human populations of the region. This species serves as a resource for the livelihoods of many people and represents a source of income in many rural communities in northeastern Brazil. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, use, collection practices, and forms of local management related to C. coriaceum in a rural community in the state of Ceará, Chapada do Araripe, northeast Brazil. Pequi collectors were identified and constituted the sample of respondents (N = 56). The knowledge of C. coriaceum is uniformly distributed in the community. The categories food and derivatives (oil) were the most relevant. Considering all use categories, there was a significant difference between the knowledge of men and women (p <0.05, 95% confidence interval) based on the Shannon-Wiener and Hurlbert's PIE diversity indices. The main form of management applied to pequi trees was collection of its fruits, followed by the practice locally referred to as zelar (similar to the management practice ""protection"") and sowing seeds. All of the informants stated that they commercialize pequi fruits. The mean income from fruit sales is less than the mean income obtained via selling pequi oil, as the latter product is of greater commercial value.

We evaluated the impact of local populations on vegetation structure and diversity of Sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f.) dominated forests of Similipal Tiger Reserve (STR), Odisha, using plot-based method. We selected eight villages, four in the buffer zone and four in the core zone of STR. We then laid two one-hectare plots in the forests adjacent to each village: one was the study plot where the local people extensively collected fuel-wood and fodder (called disturbed plot), while the other served as control and was located > 1 km away in a site with no current harvesting (called undisturbed plot). In the study plots we also evaluated the extraction pressure on vegetation over a 21-month period from 2006 to 2008. All woody species ≥ 3.18 cm dbh (diameter at breast height) were permanently marked and tagged. We monitored the rate of removal of plant parts like stem and branches at 3-month intervals to estimate extraction pressure. The species richness, diversity, basal area and stand density were lower in the disturbed compared with the undisturbed plots. Mean extraction pressure, in terms of percent trees lopped/harvested mo-1, ranged from 1.2 - 11 % and was positively correlated with the population size of villages. Fuel-wood was the major product harvested.

The fruits of this species are traditionally used in the Northern Plateau of Santa Catarina State, Brazil, in the preparation of syrup for the treatment of respiratory disorders. In this context, the aim of this study was to quantify the production of fruits and to find strategies for the possible management of natural populations of B. antiacantha. A total of 39 inflorescences were observed from January/2008 to August/2008 distributed in a secondary forest area at FLONA (National Forest), Três Barras, Santa Catarina State. In this same area, B. antiacantha individuals were accompanied by demographic studies from 2001 to 2008. The inflorescences presented on average 0.68 m of length, mean number of 187 fruits/inflorescence, mean diameter of fruits of 1.9 cm and mean weight of inflorescences of 3.6 kg. The mean number of usable fruits was 157 fruits/inflorescence and the mean weight of these fruits was 2.5 Kg. The estimated harvest for 2005 was 146 Kg of fruits ha-1 and for 2008, 80 kg of fruits ha-1, and the net income from the syrup production could reach R$ 1168.00 per hectare per year. The results showed that the management of B. antiacantha consists in an economically interesting activity and that this possibility complements the income of local communities where the species occurs, besides increasing the value of forest areas.","Medicinal plants; NTFP; Sustainable management","article; Bromelia; bromelia antiacantha; economics; fruit; harvest; inflorescence; nonhuman; sustainable agriculture; syrup; Bromelia; Caraguata","Filippon, S.; Centro de Ciências Agrárias, Rodovia Admar Gonzaga, 1346, Itacorubi, CEP: 88034-000, Florianópolis, Brazil; email: samabio82@gmail.com",,,15160572,,RBPMF,,"English; Portuguese","Rev.

A major decline in timber harvest followed, extending an earlier downward trend. The historic and projected future change in carbon (C) stores and balance on federally managed forest lands in Western Oregon (OR) and Western Washington (WA) was examined using the LANDCARB 3.0 simulation model. The projections include C stores on-site, in harvested wood products and disposal and reflect a set of contrasting visions of future forest management in the region formulated as five alternative management scenarios that extend to year 2100. A significant and long-lasting net increase in total C stores on federal forest lands relative to early 1990s level was projected for both OR and WA under all examined management scenarios except the Industry Scenario which envisioned a return to historic high levels of timber harvest. In comparison with the Industry Scenario, the low levels of timber harvest under the NWFP between 1993 and 2010 were estimated to increase total C stores by 86.0 TgC (5.1TgCyear -1 or 2.16MgCha -1year -1) in OR; in WA the respective values were 45.2TgC (2.66TgCyear -1 or 1.33MgCha -1year -1). The projected annual rate of C accumulation, reached a maximum between 2005 and 2020 approaching 4TgCyear -1 in OR and 2.3TgCyear -1 in WA, then gradually declined towards the end of projection period in 2100. Although not the original intent, the NWFP has led to a considerable increase in C stores on federal forest lands within the first decade of plan implementation and this trend can be expected to continue for several decades into the future if the limits on timber harvest set under the NWFP are maintained. The primary goal of the NWFP to protect and restore old-growth forest may take several decades to achieve in WA whereas in OR the area protected from clearcut harvest may be insufficient to meet this goal before the end of projection period in 2100. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Forest management; Landscape carbon stores; Old-growth conservation; Pacific Northwest; Timber harvest","Alternative management; Annual rates; C-Store; Carbon balance; Forest land; Harvested wood products; Landscape carbon stores; Long lasting; Low level; Managed forest; Management scenarios; Northwest Forest Plan; Old-growth; Old-growth forest; Pacific Northwest; Projection period; Simulation model; Timber harvests; Washington; Carbon; Computer simulation; Harvesting; Timber; Forestry; carbon balance; forest ecosystem; forest management; implementation process; old-growth forest; timber harvesting; Carbon; Conservation; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests; Harvesting; Simulation; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); United States; Washington [United States]","Krankina, O.N.; Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, , Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: krankinao@fsl.orst.edu",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Wood forest products (WFP) and non-wood forest products (NWFP) represent a real employment and income source for the rural population of these forest areas. Local and national incomes of NWFP in Tunisia have a crucial role in comparison to WFP. The main WFP is timber for pulpwood, particleboard, fiberboard and cardboard packaging. Similarly, NWFP produced in Tunisia include plant and animal products. The most important NWFP are edible plants, fruits, mushrooms, seeds, oils, cork, fiber, fodder, tannins, resins and gums. Furthermore, animal foodstuffs, is constituted by bush meat, trophy hunting, honey and snails. Important socioeconomic value is also attributed to medicinal and aromatic plants, such as Thymus spp., Laurus nobilis and Rosmarinus officinalis. This review pretends to emphasizes the socioeconomic importance of NWFP produced by these forests. Currently, the WFP are well known and valued while NWFP, even if they are much appreciated, they are undervalued and underestimated. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Non-timber forest products (NTFPs) make a major contribution to the livelihoods of the West African population. However, these ecosystem services are threatened by climate and land use change. Our study aims at 1) the quantification and monetary mapping of important NTFPs, and 2) developing a novel approach to assess the impacts of climate and land use change on the economic benefits derived from these NTFPs. We performed household interviews in northern Benin to gather data on annual quantities of collected NTFPs from the three most important savanna tree species: Adansonia digitata, Parkia biglobosa, and Vitellaria paradoxa. Current market prices of the NTFPs were derived from local markets. We assessed the species' current and future (2050) occurrence probabilities by calibrating niche-based models with climate and land use data at a 0.1° resolution (cell: ~10 × 10 km). To assess future economic gains and losses, respectively, we linked modeled species' occurrence probabilities with the spatially assigned monetary values. Highest current annual benefits are obtained from V. paradoxa (USD 54,111 ± 28,126/cell), followed by P. biglobosa (USD 32,246 ± 16,526/cell) and A. digitata (USD 9,514 ± 6,243/cell). The future simulations showed spatially varying impacts of environmental change. In particular A. digitata might benefit in some regions. However, large areas are projected to lose up to 50 % of their current economic value by 2050 with regard to the three species. Our findings provide a first benchmark for local policy-makers to economically compare different land use options and adjust existing management strategies. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.","Benin; climate envelope models; ecosystem service mapping; rural livelihoods; species distribution modeling","Adansonia; Adansonia digitata; Parkia biglobosa; Vitellaria paradoxa","Heubes, J.; Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre (LOEWE BiK-F), Senckenberganlage 25, 60325 Frankfurt/Main, Germany; email: jonathan.heubes@senckenberg.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English; French","Econ.

In the mountainous region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan (previously known as North West Frontier Province, NWFP) the process of institutional changes in forestry sector was also started in the mid nineties and now participation to local stakeholders has become a significant feature of the forest policy of the province. To confer practical look to the participatory forestry, village level institutions were established in the selected villages for the management of forests and carrying out developmental activities. In this milieu, this paper attempts to assess the net correlation between participation in forest management and livelihood assets of the forest dwellers by using sustainable livelihoods framework. The results showed that there was positive relationship (net correlation) between participation and the access of the respondents to social and natural assets, but other livelihood assets (financial, human and physical) remained unchanged. It is recommended that sustainable management of forest resources necessitates that the forest conservation initiatives should be coupled with the enhancement of financial and human capital of the communities living in or around forest areas.","Livelihood assets; Northwest Pakistan; Participatory approach; Social capital; Sustainable forest management",,"Shahbaz, B.; Institute of Agric.

We test the hypothesis that useful plants in general, and medicines in particular, are more likely to be pioneer and herbaceous species than any other guild or habit, using data from six communities in southeastern Liberia. Of 624 surveyed species from seven locally defined vegetation classes, 228 species (36 %) were found to be useful in the categories of food, medicine, materials, and social use. Five habits account for 98 % of surveyed species: Trees, treelets (including two palm species), lianes (including root climbers), shrubs, and herbs. Four guilds account for 93 % of the surveyed species: Swamp, shade-bearer, pioneer, and non-pioneer light demander (NPLD) species. A significantly higher proportion of pioneers is found to be useful overall (55 %) and useful medicinally (69 %) than for any other guild. However, the shade-bearing guild provides the greatest number of useful species (92 species) and the greatest number of medicinal species (55 species). Fifteen species were shortlisted by the communities for their particular importance, of which only one is a pioneer species. A similar proportion of species of each habit (about one-third of species) was found to be useful overall. In the case of medicinal use in particular, a significantly larger proportion of herbs (63 %) is medicinal than for any other habit. Our study from West Africa supports the findings of others working in the neotropics that disturbed and secondary vegetation classes are important sources of useful plants, particularly medicines. However, the greatest number of useful species are shade-bearing, which are most abundant in primary forest. Familiarity with and accessibility of old-growth forests to the communities of our study site due to Liberia's recent history is likely responsible for their usefulness. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.","disturbance; Liberia; non-timber forest product (NTFP); pioneer; plant biodiversity; Upper Guinea forest; useful plants",,"Marshall, C.

Herbal medicine is an integral part of health care in Morocco and is widely used by Moroccans. However, the efficacy and safety of traditional plant-based medicine in Morocco is threatened by insufficient knowledge about practices of adulteration and substitution. These issues are of particular importance when subterranean plant parts are employed. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was used to identify where and why confusion (accidental substitution) and intentional substitution occurs in root-based medicines sold in Marrakech. Additionally we examined local perceptions of the toxicological risks posed by substitution. We recorded a total of 20 species (34 unique cases) of roots for which substitution or confusion was reported by either herbalists or collectors. Substitution or confusion occurred in 54. 6 % of the 33 most commonly sold medicinal roots, with herbalists reporting substitution in more species than collectors. Collectors and herbalists cited poor availability of roots (in part due to overexploitation of wild resources), high demand, high prices, and lack of knowledge as factors driving substitution and confusion. Roots for which substitution was reported were significantly more difficult for herbalists to identify. Moreover, profit was higher for roots for which intentional substitution was reported. Despite the detailed knowledge held by many herbalists and a long tradition of use of herbal medicine in Morocco, doctors and pharmacists had dismissive attitudes towards traditional medicine and expressed concern about both efficacy and safety of medicinal plant use. Given the high rates of substitution and confusion documented by this study, there is an urgent need for appropriate regulation of herbal remedies in Morocco, a conclusion embraced by herbalists and Western-trained medical practitioners alike. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.","adulteration; collectors; Confusion; doctors; herbalists; identification; markets; Morocco; NTFP; pharmacists",,"Ouarghidi, A.; Laboratoire de Biotec-VRV, , Marrakech, Morocco; email: ouarghidi@hotmail.com",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English; Arabic","Econ.

With the advent of joint forest management concepts and commercial earning prospects from non-timber forest products (NTFPs), it was expected that forests would be best preserved by the villagers who depend on them for a substantial part of their livelihoods. However, in the case of the Ranibundh block in the Bankura district, it was observed that the predominance of private agencies in marketing channels of NTFPs, together with risk of eviction, loss of customary right to access forest resources, low employment prospects, and lack of training about proper management of NTFPs have led to the failure in motivating the forest dwellers to prevent degradation of forest resources. It is suggested that government agencies, producer institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other strong institutional entities can promote forest preservation when complemented by the granting of forest rights to rural people, the extension of training facilities, and alternative employment prospects. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","commercialization; forest degradation; NTFP","commercialization; Forest degradation; Forest preservation; Forest resources; Forest rights; Government agencies; Joint forest managements; Marketing channels; Non-timber forest products; Nongovernmental organizations; NTFP; Private agencies; Rural livelihood; Rural people; Training facility; West Bengal , India; Natural resources; Societies and institutions; Forestry; commercialization; forest management; forest resource; forestry production; nontimber forest product; rural economy; Degradation; Forestry; Natural Resources; Bankura; India; West Bengal","Datta, S.

However, research on cooperation has demonstrated that increased market access and income may strengthen or weaken cooperation. Because cooperation is essential for community resilience in small-scale societies, negative effects on people's well-being can be expected if increased NTFP trade reduces cooperation. To evaluate whether NTFP trade affected cooperation, we used household data (survey and systematic observations) to compare the frequency of cooperation in two communities of Brazilian Amazon Caboclos, one of which engaged in NTFP trade, while the other did not. Cooperation was less frequent in the community trading NTFPs, but neither household cash income nor household participation in NTFP exploitation was associated with cooperative behavior. Decreased frequency most likely derived from indirect effects of NTFP trade, such as less time to fish or socialize, or other outcomes observable only at the community level, such as income inequality, the influx of new residents and consequent population growth. Our results indicate that conservation and development projects based on NTFP trade may negatively impact social and economic well-being of local communities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Brazilian Amazon; Caboclos; Cooperation; Extractive reserve; Market integration; Non-timber forest products; Social capital","forest management; household income; market system; nontimber forest product; population growth; social capital; Amazonia; Brazil","Morsello, C.; Escola de Artes, Rua Arlindo Béttio, 1000, CEP: 03828-000 São Paulo, Brazil; email: morsello@usp.br",,"Springer Science and Business Media, LLC",03007839,,,,"English","Hum.

These changes result not only from human induced changes in the climate, but also from population demographic changes due to wars, social unrest, behavioral changes resulting from cultural mixing, and large changes in land-use practices. Each of these social shifts can affect the maintenance and emergence of arthropod vectors disease or the pathogenic organisms themselves. A good example is the country of Pakistan, with a large rural population and developing urban economy, it also maintains a wide diversity of entomological disease vectors, including biting flies, mosquitoes, and ticks. Pathogens endemic to the region include the agents of piroplasmosis, rickettsiosis, spirochetosis, and viral hemorrhagic fevers and encephalitis. The northwestern region of the country, including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), formerly the North-West Frontier Provence (NWFP), and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are mountainous regions with a high degree of habitat diversity that has recently undergone a massive increase in human population density due to an immigrating refugee population from neighboring war-torn Afghanistan. Vector-borne diseases in people and livestock are common in KPK and FATA regions due to the limited use of vector control measures and access to livestock vaccines. The vast majority of people in this region live in abject poverty with >70% of the population living directly from production gained in animal husbandry. In many instances whole families live directly alongside their animal counterparts. In addition, there is little to no awareness of the threat posed by ticks and transmission of either zoonotic or veterinary pathogens. Recent emergence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in rural populations, outbreaks of Dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the region, and high prevalence of cattle infected and co-infected with multiple species of hemoparasites (Theileria, Babesia, Anaplasma). The emergence of which has followed the increased density of the rural population due to an influx of refugees from violent conflicts in Afghanistan and is exacerbated by an already impoverished society and wide diversity of potential arthropod vectors.

Both species are commercially harvested for timber and non-timber products which can fetch high prices on national and international markets. In undisturbed forests, both species display a low tree density, a random adult tree distribution pattern and a flat diameter structure, or one biased towards larger trees. The random spatial distribution pattern did not vary in the three types of forests analysed, whereas individual density and diameter structure did. The NTFP extraction areas exhibited the highest population densities for both species. In the logged forests, there was a lower density of very large D. odorata trees, while the areas used for D. odorata seed extraction showed a drastic reduction in the frequency of young trees. The results of this study seem to suggest that oil extraction from C. reticulata does not have any effect on the regeneration of that species, whereas D. odorata seed collection could affect the viability of populations. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Brazilian Amazon; Copaifera reticulata; Demography; Dipteryx odorata; Non-timber forest products; Point-pattern analysis","Brazilian Amazon; Copaifera reticulata; Demography; Dipteryx odorata; Non-timber forest products; Point-pattern analysis; International trade; Population statistics; Spatial distribution; Reforestation; diameter; forest management; legume; logging (timber); Neotropical Region; nontimber forest product; population density; population structure; spatial distribution; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Copaifera reticulata; Dipteryx odorata","Sist, P.; Departamento de Ecología, Calle José Antonio Novais s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; email: sist@cirad.fr",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We used semi-structured interviews, ethnography, and secondary documents (e.g. maps and supporting documents) to provide in-depth understanding of the NTFP uses. Sts'ailes people use NTFPs by (1) gathering plants for food and medicine, (2) making materials from the plants, (3) making spiritual regalia and paints for winter ceremonials, and (4) brushing with cedar branches as spiritual practices. Forest environments and NTFPs provide secured environment for spiritual bathing and other spiritual practices and cedar branches are essential to use for purification. Because of these uses, Canadian governments need to consult and accommodate the Sts'ailes people when undertaking forestry operations.

This paper (i) quantifies the contribution that Vitellaria paradoxa makes to the total income of rural households belonging to different economic groups in two areas of Burkina Faso; (ii) quantifies the involvement of women in shea nuts and fruits collection and processing; and (iii) empirically verifies the ""gap filling"" function of shea products in Burkina Faso by quantifying the commercialization and subsistence use of shea fruits, nuts, and butter between agricultural seasons. Based on data collected from structured household surveys used on a quarterly basis during a one-year period on 536 households, we demonstrate that the reliance on shea is generally high in the sampled populations, and is at its highest for the poorest households, for which it contributes 12 % of total household income. Moreover, shea nut collection and processing was found to provide a valuable source of cash income to female household members who otherwise have very few income possibilities. Finally, due to its ecology, shea fills in an income gap during a period where human activities are at their highest while income is at its lowest. Although shea is crucial for poor people's livelihoods and for the generation of income for women, its harvesting and processing are time-consuming activities that generate low returns per unit of labor. We argue that shea collection and processing should therefore not be considered as a remedy to poverty but instead as a way for households to diversify their livelihood strategy and decrease their vulnerability to food insecurity and climate variability. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.","Burkina Faso; cash income; gap filling; NTFP; Shea; subsistence; women","Vitellaria paradoxa","Pouliot, M.; Danish Centre for Forest, Landscape and Planning, Rolighedsvej 23, 1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark; email: mapo@life.ku.dk",,,00130001,,ECBOA,,"English; French","Econ.

Design/methodology/approach: Female students from the hostels of International Islamic University, Malaysia (IIUM), Kuantan Campus and NWFP, Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan were assessed for energy and macro-nutrients intake. A total of 140 students were registered who volunteered to participate in this study. The age range of the registered students was 22-26 years. On the day of the registration, age, height and weight were recorded; also, food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) were provided. The participants were asked to record alternately for three days whatever they ate during the prescribed week. Out of 140 students 139 returned the FFQs. From the anthropometry, the BMI was used to assess the under, ideal, over-weight and obese students. From the FFQs, energy and nutrient intakes were calculated using the food composition tables for Malaysia and Pakistan and compared with the recommended nutrients intakes (RNIs). Findings: The body weight for the required height among the Malaysian students was lower by 7.81 per cent than the reference value, whereas the body weight of Pakistani students matched to the reference weight for height. The Malaysian students were 28.0, 61.0, 5.5 and 0.9 per cent under, ideal, over-weight and obese, respectively, whereas Pakistani students were 100 per cent in the category of ideal-body weight. The total energy consumption was higher among Malaysian students by 9.93 per cent compared to the reference requirements, whereas the Pakistani students claimed to meet the requirements. In terms of nutrients balancing the Malaysian students were having the ideal combination of the macro-nutrients and it was within the recommended range of 55-60, 15-20 and 25-30 per cent for carbohydrates, protein and fat, respectively; whereas the balancing of the macro-nutrients was poor among the Pakistani students and met the energy requirements at the expense of fat consumption.

In particular, we evaluated whether product processing, partnerships, or their combination was associated with a number of outcomes related to the well-being of forest inhabitants and forest conservation. We based our analyses on ethnographic and quantitative data (i.e., survey and systematic observations) gathered at seven communities from five societies of the Brazilian and Bolivian Amazon. Our results indicated that product processing and partnerships do not represent a silver bullet able to improve the results of NTFP commercialization in terms of well-being and conservation indicators. Compared with cases without interventions, households adopting partnerships but not product processing were most often associated with improved economic proxies of well-being (total income, NTFP income, food consumption and gender equality in income). In comparison, the combination of product processing and partnerships was associated with similar outcomes. Unexpectedly, product processing alone was associated with negative outcomes in the economic indicators of well-being. All of the investigated strategies were associated with less time spent in social and cultural activities. With respect to forest conservation, the strategies that included a partnership with or without processing produced similar results: while household deforestation tended to decrease, the hunting impact increased. Processing alone was also associated with higher levels of hunting, though it did not reduce deforestation. Our results indicate that establishing partnerships may enhance the outcomes of NTFP trade in terms of the financial outcomes of local communities, but practitioners need to use caution when adopting the processing strategy and they need to evaluate potential negative results for indicators of social and cultural activities. With respect to conservation, the three strategies are promising for reducing deforestation, but more pervasive impacts, such as hunting, might increase. © 2012 Morsello et al.",,"animal hunting; article; Bolivia; Brazil; commercial phenomena; cultural factor; deforestation; economic aspect; environmental protection; ethnography; food intake; forest management; household; income; non timber forest product; plant product; quantitative analysis; social aspect; wellbeing; Agriculture; Bolivia; Brazil; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ethnic Groups; Forestry; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Regression Analysis; Rural Population; Social Conditions; Socioeconomic Factors; Trees","Morsello, C.; Escola de Artes, Ciencias e Humanidades (EACH), , São Paulo, Brazil; email: morsello@usp.br",,,19326203,,,"22912787","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865076624

Effective management requires disentangling the effects of these disturbances and prioritizing interventions for the driver(s) most responsible for population decline. However, the effects of multiple drivers on plant population dynamics are rarely examined. 2.We assessed the independent and combined effects of common anthropogenic disturbances on the transient and long-term population dynamics of two economically important, declining tree species in an Indian dry forest. Specifically, we drew on 10years of demographic monitoring to assess the effects of non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvest and two invasive species (an understorey shrub Lantana camara and a mistletoe Taxillus tomentosus) on amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) populations. 3.Although fruit harvest has been blamed for declining amla populations, the current policy and management strategies implemented to restrict it have little effect on long-term stochastic growth rates (λ s) of amla both with and without invasive species. In contrast, mistletoes significantly decreased λ s of both species. 4.Lantana had both direct and indirect effects on P. emblica, causing a regeneration bottleneck. Lantana had a direct negative effect on seeding and sapling growth, whereas populations without lantana experienced higher levels of grazing by wild animals. Over 10years, P. emblica populations dropped to 16% of their original size in areas with invasive species. 5.Synthesis and applications.Our results illustrate that mistletoe and lantana, not fruit harvest, are the main drivers of amla decline, and these species are likely to be driving the decline of other Indian dry forest tree species. Management directed only at limiting fruit harvest will be ineffective. Instead, control of both invasive species combined with temporary protection from grazing is urgently needed. The ban on fruit harvest in Indian protected areas is not an effective conservation policy for these species. Harvest is not necessarily the main cause of decline for NTFP species. Management plans for NTFP and other at-risk species must consider the relative effects of different drivers of decline, including direct and indirect effects of invasive species.

We develop a modelling approach for the economic valuation of annual Non-Timber Forest Product (NTFP) extraction at a large spatial scale, which has 4 main strengths: (1) it is based on household production functions using data of actual household behaviour, (2) it is spatially sensitive, using a range of explanatory variables related to socio-demographic characteristics, population density, resource availability and accessibility, (3) it captures the value of the actual flow rather than the potential stock, and (4) it is generic and can therefore be up-scaled across non-surveyed areas. We illustrate the empirical application of this approach in an analysis of charcoal production in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania, using a dataset comprising over 1100 observations from 45 villages. The total flow of charcoal benefits is estimated at USD 14. million per year, providing an important source of income to local households, and supplying around 11% of the charcoal used in Dar es Salaam and other major cities. We discuss the potential and limitations of up-scaling micro-level analysis for NTFP valuation. © 2012.","Ecosystem services valuation; Non-timber Forest Products; Tanzania; Up-scaling","charcoal; conservation management; data set; ecological economics; forest management; forestry production; household survey; local planning; mapping; nontimber forest product; population density; public access; resource availability; socioeconomic conditions; upscaling; Eastern Arc Mountains; Tanzania","Schaafsma, M.; Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, , Norwich, NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom; email: m.schaafsma@uea.ac.uk",,,09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

Design/methodology/approach: Framed by the Whitefeather Forest Research Cooperative agreement, a collaborative and ethnographic research design was adopted with the Whitefeather Forest Management Corporation and the Whitefeather Forest Elders Steering Group in Pikangikum First Nation. Over the period of two years, initial research planning meetings were held with community representatives, fieldwork and interviews with community Elders and leaders were conducted, and three community workshops were held. Findings: Community Elders and leaders articulated a cautious interest in developing ethical, collaborative partnerships that support the Whitefeather Forest Initiative and the community's social, cultural, economic and environmental goals. Developing NTFPs through partnerships is a procedural issue that requires giving Elders a primary role in advising and guiding partnerships at all stages of NTFP planning, research and development. Partners would be expected to build respectful and diligent partnerships that interface knowledge systems, maintain good relations, and generate mutually defined benefits. Research limitations/implications: This community-specific approach provides insight for Aboriginal groups, governments, universities, and corporations seeking to develop access and benefit sharing agreements, policies, or protocols in light of the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Nagoya Protocol. Originality/value: This paper offers perspectives, principles, and community member narratives from a Canadian indigenous community, Pikangikum First Nation. These perspectives describe how this community envisions potential research, development and commercialization of NTFPs through joint and mutually beneficial partnerships. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Anishinaabe; Commercialization; Ethnic groups; Indigenous; Non-timber forest products; Partnership; Perception; Traditional knowledge",,"Davidson-Hunt, I.; Natural Resource Institute, , Winnipeg, Canada; email: Hunt@ad.umanitoba.ca",,,17506204,,,,"English","J.

However, harvesting policy intended to promote conservation are frequently either ineffective or too complicated. Successful policies should consider ecological impacts, local ecological knowledge and management practices, but NTFP policies are rarely based on these elements. Syngonanthus nitens (Eriocaulaceae, 'golden-grass') is one of the most valuable NTFPs from the Brazilian savanna. The handicrafts made from this species' flower stalks are traditional to the Jalapão region, Tocantins state, but have expanded over a much larger area in recent years. We combined ethnoecological interviews, seed phenology surveys over a large geographical area and harvest experiments in nine sites over 3. years to assess local ecological knowledge and management of golden-grass and its long-term effects on population dynamics. Although handicrafting activities are rapidly expanding, local ecological knowledge associated with harvest or management has not been transferred or created outside of Jalapão. Matrix population models illustrate that harvest according to traditional management practices had no impact on golden-grass population dynamics. Earlier harvest of golden-grass, as practiced by new artisans, leads to population decline due to plant uprooting. Local policies for golden-grass harvest are consistent with traditional management, limit the timing but not the quantity of harvest, and are appropriate over a wide geographical scale. Golden-grass and other wild harvested species with similar characteristics hold high potential to help conserve threatened habitat. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cerrado; Fire; Handicrafts; Jalapão; Management; Policy; Sustainable use; Wet grasslands","ecological approach; endangered species; flower; geographical region; grass; harvesting; knowledge; nontimber forest product; phenology; policy making; population dynamics; population modeling; savanna; sustainable development; wild population; Brazil; Jalapao; Tocantins; Eriocaulaceae; Syngonanthus nitens","Schmidt, I.B.; Ibama - Instituto Brasileiro de Meio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renováveis, Prevfogo, Bl.

Vestibular rehabilitation benefits patients but optimal treatment remains unkown. Virtual reality is an emerging tool in rehabilitation and provides opportunities to improve both outcomes and patient satisfaction with treatment. The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (NWFP) is a low cost virtual reality system that challenges balance and provides visual and auditory feedback. It may augment the motor learning that is required to improve balance and gait, but no trials to date have investigated efficacy. Methods/Design. In a single (assessor) blind, two centre randomised controlled superiority trial, 80 patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular loss will be randomised to either conventional or virtual reality based (NWFP) vestibular rehabilitation for 6 weeks. The primary outcome measure is gait speed (measured with three dimensional gait analysis). Secondary outcomes include computerised posturography, dynamic visual acuity, and validated questionnaires on dizziness, confidence and anxiety/depression. Outcome will be assessed post treatment (8 weeks) and at 6 months. Discussion. Advances in the gaming industry have allowed mass production of highly sophisticated low cost virtual reality systems that incorporate technology previously not accessible to most therapists and patients. Importantly, they are not confined to rehabilitation departments, can be used at home and provide an accurate record of adherence to exercise. The benefits of providing augmented feedback, increasing intensity of exercise and accurately measuring adherence may improve conventional vestibular rehabilitation but efficacy must first be demonstrated.

The variation in these patterns across different spatial scales has rarely been explored. We assessed the extent to which different spatial scales are useful in understanding resource distribution, using the example of an economically-significant tropical tree genus, Copaifera, which is valued across Brazilian Amazonia for its medicinal oleoresin. We mapped the spatial distribution of Copaifera trees at three nested spatial scales: basin-wide (across Brazilian Amazonia), landscape (across two contiguous extractive reserves) and local (within a 100-ha plot). Using data from our own study and an Amazon-wide forest inventory (Projeto RADAMBRASIL), we quantified the population distribution, density and size structure at the genus and species level at all three scales, relating these to two environmental variables - forest type and elevation. Spatial statistics were used to further characterize the resource at the landscape and local levels. The distribution, density and adult population structure differed between species and forest types at all three spatial scales. Overall tree densities ranged from 0.37ha -1 (basin-wide scale) to 1.13ha -1 (local scale) but varied between forest types, with várzea containing a Copaifera tree density just 43% of that in terra firme forest at the landscape scale. Spatial distribution analyses showed significant clumping of some species, especially C. multijuga which averaged 61m between neighbouring trees. We compare our cross-scale density estimates and discuss the relative merits of studying the distribution of non-timber forest products (NTFP) at more than one spatial scale. Our results have implications for the management and extraction of this important Amazonian forest resource. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Amazonia; Copaifera; Density; Non-timber forest product; Scale; Spatial distribution","Adult populations; Amazonia; Amazonian forests; Brazilian Amazonia; Copaifera; Density estimates; Environmental variables; Forest inventory; Forest resources; Forest type; Landscape scale; Local scale; Non-timber forest products; Resource distribution; Scale; Size structure; Spatial distribution analysis; Spatial scale; Spatial statistics; Successful management; Tree density; Tropical forest; Tropical tree; Density (specific gravity); Natural resources; Resins; Spatial distribution; Forestry; dicotyledon; forest inventory; forest management; forest resource; harvesting; nontimber forest product; population density; population distribution; population structure; resin; spatial distribution; tropical forest; Brazil; Forest Products; Forests; Harvesting; Natural Resources; Tropical Atmospheres; Amazonia; Brazil; Mato Grosso; Varzea Grande; Copaifera; Copaifera multijuga","Newton, P.; International Forestry Resources and Institutions, 440 Church Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; email: newton.pete@gmail.com",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

We developed approaches to create disturbance and regrowth maps for forests within the area of the NWFP from the results of LandTrendr, a temporal segmentation algorithm described previously only at the pixel scale. Maps were developed from 674 Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper. + images distributed across 22 separate scene areas, and were assessed for validity at 2360 points using TimeSync, a time-series validation and interpretation tool. Unlike maps derived using other techniques, maps derived from the segmentation approach were unique in providing simultaneous detection of abrupt disturbance, chronic disturbance, and ongoing vegetative growth with consistency across large areas and across time. Maps were then used to address six core monitoring questions focusing on the distribution of disturbance across time, ownership categories, and ecoregions. Forest was disturbed at rates that varied by ownership category and state, ranging from 9% to >. 39% of forest area over the period 1985 to 2008, with highest cumulative disturbed area on private and native lands in Washington and Oregon and lowest disturbed area on federal protected lands in Washington. Effects of court injunctions and subsequent implementation of the NWFP lowered forest disturbance rates, particularly in Oregon, and also caused decreases in the relative magnitude of disturbance on those lands relative to private lands. State-managed forests showed forest disturbance rates that varied considerably among the three states, with the highest rates in Washington state and lowest in California. Affected by large, stochastic fire events, protected lands in both Oregon and California showed disturbance rates similar to those found on actively managed federal lands. Protected lands also experienced high rates of chronic disturbance, often associated with insect-related mortality. As expected, moisture-limited ecoregions recovered vegetation more slowly than those where moisture was not limiting. Vegetative regrowth rates showed substantial variation among ownership categories, suggesting that differential forest policies may affect vegetative recovery rate. Taken together, these results emphasize that forest management policies do have manifestations at the landscape scale, but that detection of these manifestations is best achieved with mapping approaches that can detect both abrupt and longer-duration processes within the Landsat archive. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Change detection; Disturbance; Forest; Growth; Landsat; Northwest forest plan","Change detection; Disturbance; Forest; LANDSAT; Northwest Forest Plan; Growth (materials); Image segmentation; Moisture; Forestry; algorithm; ecoregion; environmental disturbance; environmental management; environmental policy; forest ecosystem; image processing; insect; Landsat thematic mapper; landscape ecology; mortality; protected area; regrowth; segmentation; spatiotemporal analysis; succession; time series analysis; vegetation mapping; Forests; Maps; Moisture; Plants; Private Ownership; Reforestation; Seasonal Variation; USA; California; Oregon; United States; Washington [United States]; Hexapoda","Kennedy, R.E.; Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, United States; email: Robert.kennedy@oregonstate.edu",,,00344257,,RSEEA,,"English","Remote Sens.

This study takes consumption expenditure as a welfare indicator and estimates poverty line by employing calorie based approach using 2350 calories per adult equivalent for the year 1998-99. To adjust the price differences between the areas during a year, the Paasche Price Index at primary sampling unit level is used so that the poverty estimates are consistent. Poverty lines for the other years are obtained by adjusting the base poverty line i.e. 1998-99 by composite price index and thus obtained poverty estimates are comparable. The results show that there was an increasing trend in poverty estimates between 1992-93 through 2001-02 except between 1993-94 and 1996-97. Whereas from 2001-02 through 2007-08 they depicted decreasing trend. Rural areas experienced more severe poverty as compared to urban areas throughout the period.

The increasing prevalence of government- and NGO-sponsored programs to encourage commercial non-timber forest product (NTFP) extractivism in the humid tropics has highlighted the need for ecological and socioeconomic appraisal of the viability of extractive industries. We adopted a novel integrative approach to examine NTFP resource potential and produced credible landscape-scale estimates of the projected value of an economically important Amazonian NTFP, the medicinal oleoresin of Copaifera trees, within two large contiguous extractive reserves in Brazilian Amazonia. We integrated results derived from previous spatial ecology and harvesting studies with socioeconomic and market data, and mapped the distribution of communities within the reserves. We created anisotropic accessibility models that determined the spatial and temporal access to Copaifera trees in permanently unflooded (terra firme) and seasonally flooded (várzea) forests. Just 64. 9% of the total reserve area was accessible, emphasizing the distinction between the actual resource stock and that which is available to extractors. The density of productive tree species was higher in the várzea forests, but per-tree productivity was greater in the terra firme forests, resulting in similar estimates of oleoresin yield per unit area (64-67 ml ha -1) in both forest types. A greater area of the várzea forests was accessible within shorter travel times of ≤250 minutes; longer travel times allowed access to increasingly greater volumes of oleoresin from the terra firme forests. The estimated total volume of oleoresin accessible within the two reserves was 38,635 liters for an initial harvest, with projected offtake for a subsequent harvest falling to 8,274 liters. A household that extracted just 2 liters of oleoresin per month could generate 5% of its mean income; market data suggested that certification could increase the value of the resource fivefold. Our approach is valuable in that it incorporates a range of methodologies and quantitatively accounts for the numerous constraints to the commercial viability of NTFP extraction. © 2012 The New York Botanical Garden.","accessibility; Amazonia; constraint; copaíba; Copaifera; extractive reserve; NTFP; oleoresin; resource","Copaifera; Copaifera langsdorffii","Newton, P.; Centre for Ecology, Evolution and Conservation, School of Environmental Sciences, , Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom; email: newton.pete@gmail.com",,,00130001,,ECBOA,,"English; Portuguese","Econ.

Increasing threats on NTFP-providing tree species, due to land-use intensification, require ecological studies as well as additional information about species' uses and management provided by local people. The objectives of our study were to (i) document uses and management of the baobab (Adansonia digitata L.), (ii) investigate knowledge distribution among genders and different villages, and (iii) assess the population status of the baobab in eastern Burkina Faso. We conducted an ethnobotanical survey among Gulimanceba people and performed a quantitative analysis using different measures of knowledge. Interviews reveal that the baobab is harvested by local people for 25 use-types. The fruits are the most important plant part and baobab products are of special importance for nutritional uses. Local management of baobab seems to be so far sufficient to maintain baobab populations. The fact that we found some differences in uses and management of baobab between genders and villages emphasizes the importance of gender- and region-related management recommendation. People are able to use and manage the baobab in a relative sustainable way as human population density is relatively low and as they have relatively good access to the forest compared to other regions of Burkina Faso. However, in the light of land-use and climate changes, adapted management strategies are required. We conclude that ethnobotanical studies on a small-scale level are of high importance in order to develop management strategies that are reliable in a specific region. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adansonia digitata; Gulimanceba; Non-timber forest products; Quantitative ethnobotany; Traditional knowledge","agricultural development; climate change; dicotyledon; ethnobotany; fruit; intensive agriculture; land use change; nontimber forest product; quantitative analysis; semiarid region; traditional knowledge; Burkina Faso; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata","Schumann, K.; Institute of Ecology, Evolution and Diversity, Max-von-Laue-Straße 13, 60438 Frankfurt, Germany; email: Schumann@bio.uni-frankfurt.de",,,01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

The establishment of protected areas and national parks however deprive them of having access to these resources. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, this study assessed the NTFPs collection situation of the fringe communities after the establishment of Kakum National Park, the extent to which the livelihood of the communities has been improved, and how the presence or absence of livelihood improvement strategies has shaped the attitudes and perceptions of the fringe communities toward the national park. The results showed that about 17% of the household leaders were unemployed. Livelihood support strategies such as livelihood alternatives and enhancement, social capital and sociological tourism were found to be absent. Opinion leaders of the communities reported that no member is involved in the management of the park. In spite of restrictions, majority (88.4%) of the household members enter the national park for NTFP collection. Hunting was found to be third highest activity. The households reported that majority of the NTFPs they collect were not processed indicating that their capacities to add value to the resource have not been developed. They believe that value addition to NTFPs could increase their income levels but did not support the theory that it could safeguard the future availability of forest resources and contribute to their sustainability. The respondents believed that once the resources are in abundance they must be exploited to meet their socio-economic needs, suggesting the nexus between illegal entry to conservation area and unsustainable exploitation of forest resources. The paper concludes that when restrictions are placed on access to forest resources and no alternative sources of income are made, illegal entry becomes the norm. The illegal NTFPs collectors would not view the resources as ""their own"" and would exploit them in an unsustainable way to meet their needs.","Forest resources; Multi-dimensional approach; Restrictions; Social capital; Sociological tourism","conservation management; forest resource; income; national park; perception; protected area; rural society; social capital; sustainability; tourism; Central Region [Ghana]; Ghana; Kakum National Park","Amoah, M.; Wood Technology and Forest Science Section, P.O.Box 1277, Kumasi, Ghana; email: martamoah@yahoo.com",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

As part of monitoring for the NWFP, we tested nearest-neighbor imputation for mapping change in older forest, defined by threshold values for forest attributes that vary with forest succession. We mapped forest conditions on >19. million. ha of forest for the beginning (Time 1) and end (Time 2) of a 13-year period using gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) imputation. Reference data were basal area by species and size class from 17,000 forest inventory plots measured from 1993 to 2008. Spatial predictors were from Landsat time-series and GIS data on climate, topography, parent material, and location. The Landsat data were temporally normalized at the pixel level using LandTrendr algorithms, which minimized year-to-year spectral variability and provided seamless multi-scene mosaics. We mapped older forest change by spatially differencing the Time 1 and Time 2 GNN maps for average tree size (. MNDBH) and for old-growth structure index (. OGSI), a composite index of stand age, large live trees and snags, down wood, and diversity of tree sizes. Forests with higher values of MNDBH and OGSI occurred disproportionately on federal lands. Estimates of older forest area and change varied with definition. About 10% of forest at Time 2 had OGSI >50, with a net loss of about 4% over the period. Considered spatially, gross gain and gross loss of older forest were much greater than net change. As definition threshold value increased, absolute area of mapped change decreased, but increased as a percentage of older forest at Time 1. Pixel-level change was noisy, but change summarized to larger spatial units compared reasonably to known changes. Geographic patterns of older forest loss coincided with areas mapped as disturbed by LandTrendr, including large wildfires on federal lands and timber harvests on nonfederal lands. The GNN distribution of older forest attributes closely represented the range of variation observed from a systematic plot sample. Validation using expert image interpretation of an independent plot sample in TimeSync corroborated forest changes from GNN. An advantage of imputed maps is their flexibility for post-classification, summary, and rescaling to address a range of objectives. Our methods for characterizing forest conditions and dynamics over large regions, and for describing the reliability of the information, should help inform the debate over conservation and management of older forest. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..","Forest monitoring; Gradient analysis; Gradient nearest neighbor; Landsat change detection; Northwest Forest Plan; Old growth","Forest monitoring; Gradient analysis; LANDSAT; Nearest neighbors; Northwest Forest Plan; Old growth; Conservation; Geographic information systems; Pixels; Forestry; algorithm; basal area; conservation planning; environmental monitoring; forest dynamics; forest management; GIS; gradient analysis; image analysis; image classification; Landsat; mapping method; nearest neighbor analysis; old-growth forest; pixel; reliability analysis; succession; time series; Algorithms; Conservation; Data Processing; Forestry; GIS; Gradient; Growth; Monitoring; Satellites; Time Series Analysis; United States; Pacific Northwest","Ohmann, J.L.; Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: janet.ohmann@oregonstate.edu",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental study. Participants (n=26; mean age 43±14, M13:F13) with quantified balance impairment took part in a 30-minute session on the NWFP using exercises and games that challenge balance. Outcomes included the System Usability Scale (SUS), a numerical rating scale of enjoyment and a post treatment questionnaire. Results: The mean SUS score was high (mean 82±18%) with only two participants rating below 50%. There was a negative correlation of age with SUS scores (r=-0.54; p=0.004). Mean numerical rating scale score (/10) for enjoyment of the NWFP session was 8.4±3. Of the participants, 88.5% said that they would like to use the NWFP in future treatment. Seventy-three percent reported more enjoyment and motivation than usual physiotherapy. No falls occurred during testing. Conclusions: This study has quantified the usability of the NWFP as a treatment for balance impairment showing high levels of usability and enjoyment with no serious adverse effects. The results of this study may assist physiotherapists in devising novel balance rehabilitation programmes. Implications for Rehabilitation The Nintendo Wii Fit Plus ® virtual reality system has the potential to improve balance rehabilitation, but usability of this system requires investigation. In this study, patients with balance impairment as a result of neurological disease reported very high levels of usability and enjoyment when performing selected Nintendo Wii Fit Plus ® balance exercises and games.

This has brought the intention of several national and multinational companies to design and implement a major work plan for energy conservation and construction of renewable energy sources like wind mills and solar panels. Fortunately, Pakistan is among those countries in which sun warms the surface throughout the year and therefore has a strong potential for solar power generation. This study was conducted to explore those areas which are most suitable for solar energy potential using fifty eight meteorological stations covering the whole country. Angstrom equation and Hargreaves formula was used to calculate monthly solar energy potential by utilizing monthly climatical data of bright sunshine hours, mean maximum and minimum temperatures. The lowest solar radiation intensity 76.49 W/m 2 observed at Cherat during December and highest 339.25 W/m 2 at Gilgit. The average monthly solar radiation intensity remains 136.05 to 287.36 W/m 2 in the country. The results indicate that the values of solar radiation intensity greater than 200 W/m 2 were observed in the months: February to October in Sindh, March to October in almost all regions of Balochistan, April to September in NWFP, Northern Areas and Kashmir regions while March to October in Punjab. For 10 h a day, average solar radiation intensity ranges from 1500 W/m 2/day to 2750 W/m 2/day in Pakistan especially in southern Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan regions throughout the year.

To evaluate the levels of serum lipoproteins in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension and compare it with the corresponding levels in pregnant women having normal blood pressure. Method. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the three tertiary care hospitals of Peshawar, North West Frontier Province, Pakistan. A total of 206 pregnant women at gestational age of >20 weeks were registered in the study after taking informed consent. All relevant information was recorded on a predesigned questionnaire. Serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels were measured in 151 women with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and compared with the corresponding values for a control group of 55 normotensive pregnant women. Result. Cholesterol levels were not statistically different between the patient group and controls. Triglyceride levels were significantly higher in the patient group than in controls. Women who developed hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation had 6.7, 4.2, 40.5, and 39.7 higher concentrations of TC, LDL-C, VLDL-C, and TG, respectively, and 28, 22.4, and 67.6 higher ratios of TC : HDL-C, LDL-C : HDL-C, and TG : HDL-C, respectively, as compared to the control subjects. The mean difference of the concentrations of HDL-C, VLDL-C, and TG, and the ratios TC : HDL-C, LDL-C : HDL-C, TG: HDL-C, and HDL-C: VLDL-C between the patients and control group was statistically significant. Conclusion. The assessment of blood lipids may be helpful in the prevention of complications in PIH patients. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Eclampsia; Lipoproteins; NWFP-Pakistan; Pregnancy Induced Hypertension","hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; article; body height; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; family history; female; gestational age; hemoglobin blood level; human; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; marriage; maternal age; maternal hypertension; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; Pakistan; parity; primipara; protein urine level; social status; systolic blood pressure; tertiary health care; thrombocyte count; triacylglycerol blood level; Adult; Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Lipoproteins; Pakistan; Pregnancy; Young Adult","Nazli, R.; Department of Biochemistry, , Peshawar, Pakistan; email: t.akhtarpmrc@gmail.com",,,10641955,,HYPPE,"20860490","English","Hypertens.

However, it is quite difficult to quantify these disturbances due to their high frequency, low intensity, and interaction among themselves. In order to quantify and investigate the impact of such disturbances on the habitat of resident and migrant birds, we carried out a study in the dry forest of Rajaji National Park in the Shiwalik landscape. Grazing and firewood collection emerged as the major disturbance in the study area, which decreased linearly from the edge to the interior of the forest. Disturbance altered the structural components of the vegetation; however, we did not find major changes in the vegetation composition. Canopy opening due to lopping disturbance facilitated the growth of iMntana camara in the study area. Ninety percent of the migrant bird community wintering in the study area belonged to the insectivorous guild. Out of 18 migrant species observed during the entire study period, 44% belonged to understorey-insectivores guild and 33% to canopy-insectivores. However, in terms of abundance 67% of the migrants pertained to the canopy- insectivores guild. Guild composition in resident birds was more varied with a total of 11 guilds, and trunk-bark feeder guild comprised the maximum number of species (20%). Species richness of both migrant and resident birds did not change much with any of the disturbance components. However, densities of resident birds increased with increased lopping and timber extraction in the study area during winter. Resident and migrant birds exhibited similar distribution patterns across different disturbance gradients indicating equivalent sensitivity to disturbances. © Bombay Natural History Society 2012.","Bird communities; Disturbances; Heterospecific attraction; Rajaji national park",,"Wildlife Institute of India, P.O.

Many tropical forests are exploited both commercially for timber and by forest-dependent communities for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Divergences between these two uses may have significant implications for forest-dependent livelihoods. This article gathers existing examples of conflicts and complementarities between selective logging and non-timber uses of forest from the livelihood perspective. Additionally it draws on three case studies from Brazil, Cameroon and Indonesia to examine by what mechanisms, and to what extent, logging impacts forest resources of livelihood importance, as well as to consider how factors such as logging regime and forest management system may mediate such influences. By doing so we aim to shed further light on a relatively unacknowledged issue in tropical forest management and conservation.Four specific mechanisms were identified; conflict of use and the indirect impacts of logging being those most commonly implicated in negative effects on livelihood-relevant NTFPs. Eighty two percent of reviewed articles highlighted negative impacts on NTFP availability. Examples of positive impacts were restricted to light demanding species that respond to the opening of forest structure and typically represent a small subset of those of livelihood value. Despite considerable impacts on livelihoods, in all three case studies we found evidence to support the potential for enhanced compatibility between timber extraction and the subsistence use of NTFPs. Drawing on this evidence, and findings from our review, we make specific recommendations for research, policy and management implementation. These findings have significant implications for reconciling timber and non-timber uses of tropical forests. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Livelihood; Multiple-use; NTFP; Reduced impact logging; Sustainable forest management; Timber","Livelihood; Multiple use; NTFP; Reduced-impact logging; Sustainable forest management; Research; Timber; Logging (forestry); community forestry; forest management; forest resource; forestry policy; indigenous population; literature review; nontimber forest product; selective logging; subsistence; sustainable forestry; tropical forest; Conservation; Forest Management; Forest Products; Logging; Brazil; Cameroon; Indonesia","Rist, L.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, , 90187 Umeå, Sweden; email: lucy.rist@emg.umu.se",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The extraction of timber and economically important NTFPs such as Brazil nuts (from the emergent forest tree Bertholletia excelsa) is occurring in the same forests and provides a clear opportunity to integrate management decisions and planning. Bolivia's forestry legislation allows, in principle, the management of multiple forest resources. However, there is little evidence that the opportunity has led to greater integration of management decisions and practice. Actually, management of each resource is typically carried out by different stakeholders with resident families responsible for Brazil nut gathering while logging companies carry out the timber harvest. This paper analyzes community forest management plans in Northern Bolivia to examine whether community residents participated in the development and implementation of the timber management plans, and the extent to which proponents of timber management plans attempted to integrate Brazil nut management into timber harvesting. The research draws on analysis of approved timber management plans for community forests and focus group interviews with residents in selected forest communities. Based on observations, the paper concludes that multiple-use management in these forests could be improved by strengthening community level institutions by confirming their authority over timber management operations and by building capacity to oversee and monitor the extraction activities of loggers working on their land. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Brazil nut; Community forestry; Non-timber forest products; Small-scale forestry; Timber harvesting","Brazil nut; Community forestry; Non-timber forest products; Small-scale forestry; Timber harvesting; Agriculture; Decision making; Timber; Logging (forestry); community forestry; deciduous tree; forest management; forestry policy; legislative implementation; logging (timber); management practice; nontimber forest product; rainforest; stakeholder; timber harvesting; Agriculture; Bertholletia; Bolivia; Decision Making; Forest Management; Forest Products; Forestry; Harvesting; Legislation; Planning; Amazonia; Bolivia; Bertholletia excelsa","Cronkleton, P.; Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), P.O.

Despite significant inputs, smallholders generated at best annual net incomes of US$200-$1,000 per ha from NTFP plantations, and up to US$800-$1,000 from timber plantations in the year of harvest. This corresponded to around one-third of the initially expected returns. Overall, only around 1% of the smallholders participating in such initiatives managed to produce and commercialize any plantation products. Smallholders' practices of complementary tree growing in conjunction with agriculture and managing natural regeneration of timber and NTFP products were often underestimated by professionals. They required low input, didn't rely on external support, were highly flexible in risky environments, and some presented financial returns comparable to some well functioning plantations. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agroforestry; Amazon; Cost-benefit analysis; Low-input initiatives; Smallholders; Tree plantations","agroforestry; cost-benefit analysis; financial services; harvesting; participatory approach; plantation; smallholder; timber; Amazonia; Bolivia; Brazil; Ecuador; Peru","Hoch, L.; Institute of Silviculture, Tennenbacherstrasse 4, 79106 Freiburg, Germany; email: lisahoch@web.de",,,01674366,,AGSYE,,"English","Agrofor.

Focus groups, semi-structured interviews and household surveys were conducted to document current and historical patterns of aguaje harvest and management, the importance of aguaje to household income, and to identify current harvesting strategies and key perceptions regarding management. This was complemented with ecological sampling in 12 aguaje stands to determine population abundance, population structure, and sex ratio. Results indicated that M. flexuosa stands show clear evidence of past over-exploitation, with a current sex ratio of 3.48 males for each female, and low adult female densities (21females/ha). Despite this, M. flexuosa remains highly abundant and populations maintain an inverted J-curve structure; however, results also showed a significant relationship between low densities of adult females and low densities of seedlings (R 2=0.476; p=0.013), suggesting that the felling of females from the canopy is reducing recruitment rates. The current state of M. flexuosa populations corroborates the harvest history as told by interviewees that intensive destructive harvesting began in the 1990s and has since waned, primarily due to the decline in the stock of females and low prices. Attempts at non-destructive harvesting, via the use of climbing harnesses has had mixed success as nearly half of the M. flexuosa palms harvested in 2010 were cut down rather than climbed. Scarcity of adult females and low prices resulted in low return on effort, and current income from aguaje accounts for just 5% of the communities' cash income. Results indicated that four factors synergistically interact to hinder development of sustainable aguaje management: (1) low resource stock, (2) market barriers, including poor market access and low prices, (3) limited access to climbing technology and training, and (4) limited organizational experience at a community level, which limits the effectiveness of attempts to mitigate the first three barriers. Despite these challenges, the Maijuna and aguaje have many attributes associated with successful management of natural resources. Our study suggests that in cases where forest resources have already been degraded, transitioning to more sustainable management alternatives can be difficult as a number of ecological and socio-economic factors interact to hinder implementation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Arecaceae; Community resource management; Forest resources; Mauritia flexuosa; Non-timber forest product (NTFP); Sustainable harvest","Arecaceae; Community resources; Forest resources; Mauritia flexuosa; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable harvest; Ecology; Economic analysis; Forestry; Natural resources; Population statistics; Resource allocation; Sustainable development; Harvesting; appropriate technology; community resource management; consumption behavior; environmental factor; evergreen forest; exploitation; forest resource; harvesting; household income; household survey; indigenous population; management practice; market conditions; nontimber forest product; perception; population structure; price dynamics; recruitment (population dynamics); resource scarcity; sex ratio; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; training; Ecology; Economic Analysis; Forest Products; Forestry; Harvesting; Natural Resources; Sociology; Sustainable Forest Management; Amazonia; Peru; Arecaceae; Mauritia flexuosa","Horn, C.M.; Division of Applied Plant Ecology, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Road, Escondido, CA 92027, United States; email: CHorn@sandiegozoo.org",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

This paper investigates the impacts of rattan harvesting on tree and understorey vegetation structure, species richness and diversity. Tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soil and topographic variables were recorded in forest plots. Interviews with rattan harvesters recorded information on harvesting techniques and locations. The relationships between tree and understorey vegetation characteristics and soils, topography and rattan harvesting techniques were assessed with the multivariate ordination technique of Redundancy Analysis (RDA). Analysis of the relationships with rattan harvesting proximity and forest designation zone used Multivariate Analyses of Covariance (MANCOVA). Tree species richness and diversity are primarily affected by slope gradient and altitude, while tree size is affected mainly by soil chemical factors. Only a small part of the variation in tree structure measures can be attributed to the impacts of rattan cane harvesting. Stronger adverse effects on understorey vegetation density, including tree saplings and seedlings, were found. This is thought to be a case of rattan harvesting exacerbating the effects of competition between rattan plants and other understorey vegetation. Longer term monitoring of forest characteristics could provide stronger understanding of the impacts. However, rattan harvesting appears to have little effect on forest structure and diversity in Lambusango Forest, suggesting that relatively small scale NTFP extraction does not necessarily conflict with forest conservation. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Buton Island; Forest conservation; Forest structure; Non-timber forest product; Rattan cane harvesting","Adverse effect; Buton Island; Chemical factors; Forest conservation; Forest plots; Forest structure; Indonesia; Multi variate analysis; Non-timber forest products; Redundancy analysis; Slope gradients; Small scale; Species richness; Tree diversity; Tree saplings; Tree size; Tree species; Tree structures; Understorey vegetation; Vegetation structure; Conservation; Harvesting; Multivariant analysis; Soils; Timber; Vegetation; Forestry; altitude; forest management; harvesting; monocotyledon; nontimber forest product; soil chemistry; species diversity; species richness; topography; understory; vegetation structure; Buton; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Southeast Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Calamus rotang","Widayati, A.; World Agroforestry Centre - ICRAF Southeast Asia, , Sindangbarang, Bogor 16115, Indonesia; email: a.widayati@cgiar.org",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

I argue that NTFP extraction as part of a productive bricolage process - defined as 'the flexible and dynamic crafting together of various livelihood options and its associated impacts on the landscape' - holds limited potential for poverty alleviation as it is mostly a sign of economic precariousness. Regarding the impact of NTFP production on the landscape, I demonstrate that the productive bricolage concept is useful for reinterpreting Wiersum's writings on the evolutionary continuum of forest-people interactions and the co-domestication of forests and trees. However, a more encompassing approach is needed considering the decreasing autonomy of community forestry and the growing integration of NTFP production into commercial networks and multilevel governance regimes. I propose political ecology as the overall perspective to deal with such multiscalar influences. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers The Netherlands.

One of the most widely traded resins is frankincense, tapped from several Boswellia tree species (Burseraceae). Exploited Boswellia populations often show poor regeneration, but the demographic consequences of these bottlenecks are unknown. Here we report on the first large-scale demographic study of frankincense-producing trees. We studied 12 populations of Boswellia papyrifera in northern Ethiopia, varying in altitude and productivity. Six of these populations had been tapped before and were tapped during the study. Survival, growth and fecundity were determined for 4370 trees and 2228 seedlings, in 22.8ha over a 2-year period. We also studied a remote population where no grazing and tapping took place. Matrix models were used to project population growth and frankincense production under four restoration scenarios. Population structures of both tapped and untapped populations showed clear gaps. Small seedlings were abundant in all populations, but none developed into persistent saplings. Such saplings were only present in the remote population. Fire and grazing are the likely causes of this regeneration bottleneck. Adult mortality was high (6-7% per year) in both tapped and untapped populations, probably caused by beetle attacks and fire. Unexpectedly, tapped populations presented higher diameter growth rates and fecundity compared to untapped populations. These differences are probably caused by non-random selection of exploited populations by tappers. Under the 'business as usual' scenario, population models projected a 90% decline in the size of tapped and untapped populations within 50years and a 50% decline in frankincense yield within 15years. Model simulations for restoration scenarios revealed that populations and frankincense production could only be sustained with intensive management leading to full sapling recruitment and a 50-75% reduction in adult mortality. Synthesis and applications.Regeneration bottlenecks and high adult mortality are causing rapid decline in frankincense-producing tree populations in Ethiopia. This decline is unlikely to be a consequence of harvesting and is probably driven by fire, grazing and beetle attacks. Fire prevention and the establishment of non-grazing areas are needed. Our results show that other factors than exploitation may seriously threaten populations yielding NTFP. © 2011 The Authors.

The stream evaluation was based on inchannel data (e.g., substrate, pieces of large wood, water temperature, pool frequency, and macroinvertebrates) we sampled from 2002 to 2009 (193 watersheds) as part of a repeating sample design. We just completed our first round of sampling, so only current condition was calculated for this data set. When condition scores for the inchannel data were grouped into categories, relatively few fell into the low (10 percent) and very low (1 percent) categories. The majority of inchannel attribute scores fell into the moderate (35 percent) and high (41 percent) condition ranges, with relatively few (12 percent) in the very high category. For low-scoring watersheds, water temperature was often the most influential factor. Aquatic invertebrate scores also appeared influential in producing the low scores. An evaluation of upslope and riparian (watershed-wide) conditions for all 1,379 sixth-field watersheds in the NWFP area with significant federal ownership was based on mapped data, including road metrics from U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management geographic information system road layers and vegetation metrics derived from satellite imagery. Watershed-wide condition scores were calculated for 1994 and 2008, and the difference between these scores was used to represent trend. Regarding status, the overall condition scores of the 1,379 watersheds mostly fell into the low (21 percent), moderate (27 percent), high (26 percent), and very high (22 percent) categories; relatively few watersheds scored in the very low (4 percent) category. The majority of watersheds (69 percent) had a positive change in condition scores (trend). Of those with larger positive changes, most were driven by both improvements in road (decommissioning) and vegetation (natural growth) scores. The greatest negative score changes were caused by the Biscuit Fire and other fires along the eastern side of the Cascades. Half of the fire-affected watersheds were in congressional reserves, 35 percent in late-successional reserves, and 15 percent in matrix (lands identified for timber production).","Aquatic conservation strategy; Aquatic ecosystems; Decision-support models; Effectiveness monitoring; Northwest Forest Plan; Pacific Northwest; Riparian ecosystems; Status and trend monitoring; Watersheds","aquatic organism; conservation planning; data set; decision support system; forest fire; forestry production; GIS; land management; macroinvertebrate; riparian forest; road; sampling; satellite imagery; stream; water temperature; watershed; Cascade Range; Pacific Northwest; United States; Invertebrata","Lanigan, S.

This paper examines NTFPs' role in contributing to the household economy and how different socio-economic factors may influence this contribution. Field methods involved quantitative and qualitative data collection of forest-adjacent households of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh. Results show that the contribution of different types of NTFPs to household economy varies in terms of subsistence and cash income. However, overall NTFP income is much higher than income from timber or firewood which indicates a larger dependence of the households on NTFPs. Income data analysis also finds that the poor households are relatively more dependent on NTFPs for their subsistence and cash income than the better-off households. Moreover, the study reveals that there are many other socio-economic factors at the household level such as number of members in household and total value of household implements and furniture that are significantly correlated with the NTFP income.

This observation, however, must be tempered by the sheer variety of non-timber forest products and NTFP production systems. Some intensively managed NTFP production systems result in localized loss of biodiversity. Thiollay (1995) found that avian species richness, diversity and equitability was significantly lower in Sumatran agroforestry systems producing rubber (Hevea brasiliensis), damar (Shorea javanica) and durian (Durio zibethinus) than in primary forests. As reported in the maple syrup (Acer saccharum) and benzoin (Styrax spp.) species profiles in Chapters 15 and 23, intensive production of these exudates may also lead to forest simplification and loss of diversity. Yet, in comparison to other land uses, NTFP management can play a positive role in forest conservation. From the Dayak forest fruit gardens (tembawangs – see de Jong, 1995) of Kalimantan, Indonesia, to the silvopastoral (dehesas) systems of the Mediterranean (see the Mediterranean species profiles in Chapter 17), NTFP management supports the maintenance of forests and many of their attendant ecosystem services. While some might not consider silvopastoral systems as ‘true forests’, such systems do provide important ecological services, help maintain biodiversity and are perceived as stable ecological systems by local environmentalists (Moussouris, 1999). © WWF, 2002, 1986 WWF.

Sustainable extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is considered best feasible strategy for forest conservation in biodiversity rich areas. This paper examines the heterogeneity of NTFPs use by tribal communities in northeast India, a global hot spot by examining diversity of NTFPs at-large, its consumption pattern, and contribution to rural income and forest revenue. A total of 343 NTFPs recorded used for diverse purposes by tribal communities. When species choice grouped as per use category, utilization for medicinal (163 species), edible fruits (75 species) and vegetables (65 species) purposes was reasonably high. Community dependence on forest resources was 100% for firewood and house construction material. 76 plant species were sold in three major local markets while an additional 22 species traded at commercial scale mainly outside the state. NTFPs contributed 19-32% of total household income for different tribal communities, which was significant. Illicium griffithii, Rubia cordifolia, Oroxylum indicum, Swertia chirayita, Litsea sebifera, Taxus wallichiana, Valeriana jatamansii, Thalictrum foliolosum, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Everniastrum cirrhatum, Cordyceps sinensis, Aconitum fletcherianum, Nardostachys jatamansi, Picrorhiza kurrooa, Gymnadenia orchidis, Calamus, Quercus and Pinus roxbughii were important commercial species. NTFPs also generated substantial revenue to the State government, though it is falling year after year, which is alarming. To meet community livelihoods, income and forest revenue from NTFPs, it desires a thorough management plan and policy guidelines for these resources from all line departments. The knowledge on diversity, its consumption pattern, and contribution to rural income and forest revenue may enable planners to accurately plan sustainable management of NTFP resources and community development in near future. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Commercial extraction; Community livelihood; Consumption pattern; Forest management; Non-timber forest products; Rural income","Commercial extraction; Community development; Community livelihood; Consumption patterns; Cordyceps sinensis; Edible fruits; Forest conservation; Forest resources; Hot spot; House construction; Household income; Humid tropics; Illicium griffithii; Local markets; Long-term management; Management plans; Non-timber forest products; Oroxylum indicum; Plant species; Quercus; Rubia cordifolia; State governments; Sustainable management; Taxus wallichiana; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Timber; Forestry; Biodiversity; Commerce; Conservation; Forest Products; Humidification; Incomes; India; Tropics; Aconitum; Cordyceps sinensis; Everniastrum cirrhatum; Gymnadenia; Illicium; Litsea; Litsea sebifera; Nardostachys; Nardostachys jatamansi; Oroxylum indicum; Picrorhiza kurrooa; Quercus; Rubia cordifolia; Swertia; Taxus wallichiana; Thalictrum; Thalictrum foliolosum; Valeriana","Sundriyal, R.C.; Herbal Research and Development Institute, Gopeshwar (Chamoli) - 246401, Uttarakhand, India; email: sundriyalrc@yahoo.com",,,13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

This paper offers a systematic review of recent trends (2000-2010) in the ecological and economic sustainability of NTFPs. Of 101 NTFP ecological studies, most addressed harvest consequences at the population-individual level (62.4%), and over half (52.5%) were carried out in Latin America. Nearly two-thirds of research (63.3%) reported that extraction was sustainable or likely to be so, compared to less than one -fifth (17.8%) that found it to be unsustainable. Extractive enterprise in Latin America was most often reported as ecologically sustainable (82.6%), and least often in Asia (58.8%). Because little of the economic NTFP literature identifies whether extractive returns meet the financial needs of extractors, at least on a daily basis, we outline economic sustainability criteria in terms of whether returns surpass an absolute poverty line or alternative wage. Of the 71 articles presenting financial data, over two-thirds met or exceeded the threshold of economic sustainability. Roughly 75% of studies demonstrated that gatherers earned more than USD$2 PPP/day (the international absolute poverty line) or more than a local wage. These positive results do not, however, demonstrate that gathering reduces long-term poverty because forest dependence, and likely tenure security, remains low among these populations. Caution must be exercised in terms of extending these results into the future, as changing economic conditions, rates and sources of habitat modification, and climate change all point to increased extractive pressures on tropical forests and savannas.","Ecological sustainability; Economic sustainability; Ethnobotany; Extraction; Non-timber forest product; Non-wood forest product",,"Voeks, R.; Department of Economics, Fullerton 800 N.

Methods: A total of 116 patients with chronic hepatitis C were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based detection out of which 112 chronic HCV patients [53 male (47.32%), 59 female (52.68%); mean age (43.76±16.40) years; mean BMI (23.8±3.9) kg] were enrolled in this study. The frequency of 6 HCV genotypes and associated risk factors were evaluated from five districts of North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Results: Genotype 3 was the most prevalent in 73 samples (65.17%) followed by genotype 1 in 24 (21.42%) and genotype 2 in 13 (11.60%) samples. Genotype 3 had significantly high prevalence (P=0.000 2). The results showed that 48 (42.85%) samples were infected with HCV 3a; 25 (22.32%) with 3b; 14 (12.50%) with 1a; 10 (8.92%) with 1b; 11 (9.82%) with 2a; 2 (1.78%) with 2b; and 2 were untypable. The distribution of HCV genotypes in Mardan, Charsadda, Peshawar, Sawabi and Nowshehra districts was different. Use of unsterile equipment for medication, barbers and previous history of hospitalization were the main risk factors for HCV transmission. Conclusions: Genotype 3a and 3b, 1a, 1b and 2a are the common genotypes in NWFP. Genotype 4, 5, and 6 can not be found in a single sample. The level of awareness about various modes of transmission of HCV among the population is found to be very low. © 2012 Asian Pacific Tropical Biomedical Magazine.","Genotypes; HCV; Molecular study; NWFP; PCR; Risk factors; Subtype 3a; Transmission","adult; article; blood sampling; controlled study; demography; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; genotype; genotype 1b; genotype 2a; genotype 3a; genotype 3b; genotype 4; genotype 5; genotype 6; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; molecular epidemiology; Pakistan; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; virus detection; virus transmission; classification; disease transmission; genetics; genotype; genotyping technique; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; isolation and purification; middle aged; molecular epidemiology; transmission; virology; Hepatitis C virus; virus RNA; Adult; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Female; Genotype; Genotyping Techniques; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Pakistan; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors; RNA, Viral","Safi, A.Z.; Atta-ur-Rahman School of Applied Biosciences (ASAB), National University of Science and Technology (NUST), National University of Sciences and Technology, H-12 Islamabad, Pakistan; email: safi.nust@yahoo.com",,"Asian Pacific Tropical Biomedicine Press",22211691,,,"23569965","English","Asian Pac.

The goal pursued in this paper is to examine and analyze the organizational leadership of an enterprise system for processing and marketing of medicinal plants, primarily from the marketing aspect. Focusing on the leading companies in the industry, in Vojvodina, the research is conducted with the purpose of gaining insight into the functioning of organizational structures and ways of organizing marketing activities in it. The subject of this study was to go from the moment of purchase of raw material base and distribution of finished products. As a research technique, it is used a survey that included questions about how to organize the department in the company, personnel structure and other internal features of the company. On that basis it is formed a SWOT matrix, in which are confronted by the weak and strong companies with external opportunities and threats. The maximum capacity utilization of the developed distribution network and price competitiveness, contribute to the leading position of the surveyed company.","Entrepreneurs; Leader; Marketing; Non-wood forest products; Organization; Vojvodina","Forestry; Marketing; Purchasing; Raw materials; Sales; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Capacity utilization; Entrepreneurs; Leader; Marketing activities; Non-wood forest products; Organizational structures; Price competitiveness; Vojvodina; Commerce; Forest Products; Market Research; Sustainable Forest Management","Keča, L.M.; University of Belgrade, Faculty of Forestry, 1, Kneza Višeslava street, Belgrade, Serbia",,"University of Novi Sad, Faculty of Technology",,,,,"English","CEFood - Proc.

Such programmes include dolphin-safe tuna, kosher-certified foods, sweatshop-free clothing, bird-friendly coffee, fairtrade coffee, environmentally safe electricity and cruelty-free cosmetics. Such labels empower consumers to voice their concerns directly through their purchases, instead of indirectly through their votes. While over half of all Americans consider the environmental attributes of a product (EPA, 1993), savvy consumer-citizens are increasingly distrustful of industry claims and corporate green-washing and have begun seeking out third-party assurances regarding the products they purchase. © WWF, 2002, 1986 WWF.

NTFPs are important for local livelihoods and the harvest of many species has relatively less impact on forest habitats than other land uses such as logging and clearing for agriculture. As a result, NTFP marketing and management strategies are often incorporated within conservation and development programmes. These programmes seek to develop sustainable livelihoods and alternative incomes for local communities, thereby reducing pressure on forests – with mixed results over the years (Crook and Clapp, 1998). Some projects work on a local level to develop sustainable management and local marketing strategies for highly threatened and/or valuable species.

Numerous pre-stressed concrete linings, featuring diameters of up to 6 m, have been successfully implemented over the last few decades. This paper on the Niagara Tunnel Facility Project (NTFP) illustrates how the concept of passive pre-stressing can be further developed for application in increasingly complex geometrical and geotechnical boundary conditions. The diversion tunnel with an excavation diameter of 14.4 m was advanced in horizontal layers of sedimentary rock, which are characterised by a wide range of strengths and anisotropic stiffnesses as well as by pronounced time-dependent deformation behaviour. The in-situ stress field is marked by an exceptionally high horizontal stress, which s several times greater than the overburden pressure. The ground has a considerable swelling potential and is highly aggressive to concrete. This combination of difficult geotechnical conditions and unusual structural dimensions poses an unprecedented challenge to the designers with respect to both the design of the pre-stressed final lining and the planning of the grouting works. The long-term behaviour is modelled with the help of higher-order creep and shrinkage laws, which are calibrated based on trials and measurements. © 2012 Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co.

At the national level, both countries allowed the utilisation of most NWFPs, did not regulate the use, and did not include NWFPs into forest management plans. In both case studies, historical use of NWFPs was intensive. This use remained important in Ukraine, but not in Sweden. Due to difficult economic transition in Ukraine, use of NWFPs by locals has increased. While hunting as a tradition was more popular in the Swedish case study, recreational use of forest was popular in both case studies.

One of them is the direct inadvertent destruction of habitats by people which is done basically through inappropriate resource use or pollution the other highly serious but under estimated problem is the threat to natural and semi-natural habitats by invasion of alien organisms it is the lasting threat as compared to the first one because when exploitation stops the existing aliens do not disappear but continue to spread and consolidate. Our planet is quickly being taken over by hundreds of hardy aggressive species spread either knowingly or accidentally by human hands these are considered the second most significant threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction. These weeds are causing damages worth billions of dollars world wide and Pakistan being no exception. The countries rich repository of 6,000 of vesicular plants is highly threatened by a number of alien weeds among those some are worth mentioning such as Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus), Lantana (Lantana camara), Paper mulberry (Brossonetia papyrifera), Mesquet (Prosopis juliflora), Wild tamarind (Leucaena leucocephala), Khakiweed (Alternanthera pungens) etc. These weeds especially P. hysterophorus are highly noxious plant species and threatening the natural and agriculture ecosystem of the country. Parthenium is allergenic to both humans and animals and after invading Punjab is quickly moving towards NWFP. This is primarily because of unawareness about this plant and secondly that it is being constantly used in floral bouquets. Similarly there are many more in the list developed by IUCN in the year 2000 for Pakistan. Though it is difficult to manage these aggressive alien organisms but success stories have been documented regarding biological/chemical control and other integrated approaches. More over a careful revision of legislation regarding quarantine and enforcement of the same may prove useful to mitigate the threats of these weeds. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

This equates to 0.5% of the 20,000 edible species (Leakey and Tomich 1999). The process of domestication in many of these species goes back thousands of years, for example, barley domestication started in the Neolithic Age, while fruits like oranges and apples go back about 3,000 years in China and central Asia respectively (Simmonds 1976). Against this background the domestication of tropical tree crops, such as mango and lychee, is very recent, probably only within the last century. Likewise, the concept of domesticating trees for timber and non-timber products in forestry emerged only within the last 30 to 40 years (Okafor 1980, 1983, Leakey et al. 1982, Leakey 1991). In 1992, a conference in Edinburgh recognized the need to domesticate the trees that have in the past provided poor people with their everyday needs for food, medicinal and other forest products (Leakey and Newton 1994a, b). At this conference, these species were described as “Cinderella species” because they have been overlooked by science and the “Green Revolution” (Leakey and Newton 1994c). The recent history of agroforestry tree domestication has been chronicled by Leakey et al. (2005a, 2007), and the products of these cultivated trees are now termed Agroforestry Tree Products (AFTPs) to distinguish them from the extractive resource of Non-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) (Simons and Leakey, 2004). Agroforestry practices are especially numerous in the tropics and used by more than 1.2 billion people. They produce the products that are important for the livelihoods of millions of other people in developing countries. The area under agroforestry world-wide has not been determined, but probably exceeds 100 million hectares. Like organic farming, conservation agriculture and ecoagriculture, agroforestry addresses soil fertility management issues for the rehabilitation of degraded farming systems; loss of biodiversity above and below ground; carbon sequestration; and soil and watershed protection. In addition, agroforestry provides: (i) useful and marketable tree products for income generation, fuel, food and nutritional security/health and the enhancement of local livelihoods (Leakey et al. 2005d); (ii) functioning agroecosystems akin to natural woodlands and forests (Leakey 1996); (iii) linkages with culture through the food and other products of traditional importance to local people (Wynberg et al. 2003). © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9781139019514; 9780521764599,,,"English","Biodivers. in Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution, and Sustainability",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859908242

The sustainable extraction of NTFPs is increasingly regarded as an important part for forest conservation strategies. This paper provides an overview and comparison of existing statutory legislation with respect to the extraction and trade of NTFPs in four Andean countries and discusses its adequacy with respect to ensuring legal and sustainable extraction and trade of NTFPs. The related legal framework surrounding indigenous peoples' rights, traditional knowledge and access to genetic resources is also reviewed. Forest laws are primarily concerned with the regulation of timber. Hence, legal and administrative frameworks to regulate the extraction and trade of NTFPs are fragmented and ambiguous. By providing an overview over the existing legal situation, this paper seeks to inform and open debates about ways to improve the regulation of the extraction and trade of NTFPs in the region. © 2011 The New York Botanical Garden.","Andean countries; Legislation; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable management",,"de la Torre, L.; Herbario QCA, Av. 12 de Octubre 1076 y Roca, Quito, Ecuador; email: lu.delatorresalvador@gmail.com",,,00068101,,BOREA,,"English","Bot.

In this paper we estimate transferable household production functions of NTFP extraction in the Eastern Arc Mountains (EAM) in Tanzania, based on information from several multisite datasets related to the behaviour of over 2000 households. These micro-level models can be used to predict the value of NTFP collection across a broader spatial scale. The study shows that the total benefit flow of charcoal, firewood, poles and thatch from the EAM to the local population has an estimated value of TSH 59 billion (USD 42 million) per year, and provides an important source of additional income for local communities, especially the poorest. We therefore argue that further restrictions on forest access to promote conservation will require additional policies to prevent a consequent increase in poverty, and an enforced trade-off between conservation and energy supply to rural and urban households.","Benefit transfer; Environmental valuation; Non-timber forest products","charcoal; conservation planning; decision making; ecosystem service; energy resource; environmental economics; forest management; forest resource; household income; montane forest; nontimber forest product; poverty; socioeconomic impact; spatial distribution; trade-off; valuation; Eastern Arc Mountains; Tanzania","Schaafsma, M.; Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, , Norwich, United Kingdom; email: m.schaafsma@uea.ac.uk",,,09678875,,,,"English","Work.

Using panel data for 200 households in 2008 and 2009, an econometric analysis revealed NTFP extraction as an important ex-post coping mechanism for the HIV/AIDS-afflicted households. Many of the households responded to HIV-related economic crises by increasing NTFP extraction to smooth both consumption and income. On average, the additional income from NTFPs offset about 48% of a household's income shortfalls due to the impact of HIV or AIDS. The importance of NTFPs as an economic safety-net for households depends more on the timing of extraction than on the magnitude (i.e. as a share of total household contribution). Hence, sustainable forest management is of great value for semi-arid tropical areas, such as the Sengwe communal lands, which are hard hit by the HIV epidemic. Consequently, government and other stakeholders would be well advised to implement programmes that reduce pressure on the forest resources, such as by introducing other incomegenerating enterprises like raising small livestock, while improvements in access to education and healthcare will further help the rural poor cope with HIV/AIDS-induced economic crises.

Collection is illegal during the dry season due to concerns about fires. Despite the threat of unexploded ordnance, villagers did not judge metal collection especially dangerous. Though metal is declining, scrap collection remained the principle reason people entered the forest. Though many Khe Tran villagers had past experiences as metal collectors most now favoured cultivation and plantation management. In contrast many collectors from elsewhere lacked such options. Collectors often sought other products when looking for metal, thereby facilitating trade in these forest products (e.g. bamboo and rattan).

A relatively moist, Mediterranean climate, natural woodlands of evergreen, sclerophyllous oaks and planted forests of Mediterranean pines and cypresses characterize the vast majority of forestlands in northern Israel. In contrast, an eastern semi-arid pocket associated with the Syrian-African Rift Valley presents challenging environmental conditions for afforestation efforts as practiced by the British Mandatory Forest Department, the Israeli Governmental Forest Department, the Keren Kayemeth Leisrael (KKL) and private entrepreneurs over the past 80 years. The accumulated experiences of planting new forests in this semi-arid zone, combined with results from introduction plots and afforestation areas throughout Israel, led to the development of a unique set of silvicultural tools and tree species employed to guarantee successful afforestation plans. All of these new afforestations function as multipurpose forestry systems offering landscape, watershed, soil conservation, pasture, recreational and NWFP goods and services and can provide a relevant model of sustainable forest management for semi-arid and arid zones worldwide. © 2011 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,"Ginsberg, P.; Land Development Authority - Forest Department, PO Box 45, Kiryat Haim 26103, Israel; email: Paulg@kkl.org.il",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781617612152,,,"English","Semi-Arid Environments: Agriculture, Water Supply and Vegetation",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892065024

We evaluated to what extent development interventions improved the financial situation of households by comparing project and control households. The financial importance of njansang to household livelihoods between 2005 and 2010 was investigated through semi-structured questionnaires with retrospective questions, focus group discussions, interviews and wealth-ranking exercises. The importance of njansang increased strongly in the entire study region and the increase was significantly larger in project households. Moreover, absolute numbers of income from njansang commercialization as well as relative importance of njansang in total cash income, increased significantly more in project households (p < 0.05). Although the lower wealth class households could increase their income through njansang trade, the upper wealth class households benefited more from the projects' interventions. Group sales as conducted in project villages did not lead to significantly higher prices and should be reconsidered. Hence, promotion of njansang had a positive effect on total cash income and can still be improved. The corporative actors for njansang commercialization are encouraged to adapt their strategies to ensure that also the lower wealth class households benefit from the conducted project interventions. In this respect, frequent project monitoring and impact analysis are important tools to accomplish this adaptation.","Cameroon; Commercialization; Income; Market; NTFP; Ricinodendron heudelotii; Rural development","Ricinodendron heudelotii","Cosyns, H.; Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Agronomy and Ethnobotany, Coupure links 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; email: Hannes.Cosyns@ugent.be",,,16129830,,,,"English","J.

The effect on the ecosystem is little known, and the forests resilience is badly understood. Palms are the most useful group of plants in tropical American forests. This paper introduces a cross-disciplinary study of the effects of harvesting palm products from the tropical forests in north-western South America. The size of the resource is estimated through palm community studies in the different forest formations that determines the number of species and individuals of all palm species. The genetic structure of useful palm species is studied to determine how much harvesting of the species contributes to genetic erosion of its populations, and whether extraction can be made without harm. Almost all palm species are used in rural communities for subsistence purposes Quantitative ethno-botanical research in different forest types have identified thousands of different ways of using palms for food, construction, tool-making, etc. Although most palms are used by the person harvesting them, many are sold on local markets as fruits, fiber, tools, construction materials etc., and a few have reached larger markets, including international markets. Palm populations are managed in various ways of which some are sustainable and others are destructive.

Leaves and seeds of Chamaedorea (xate) palms are important non-timber forest products (NTFPs). In the Calakmul region (Yucatan Peninsula) of Mexico, several communities have sporadically collected and sold seeds of C. seifrizii since 1980. However, harvesting has intensified recently, raising concerns about overexploitation. To evaluate the economic potential of leaf and seed exploitation in the area, we collected information on abundance, population patterns, and leaf and seed stocks in Ejido Conhuas, a community within the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve (CBR). Then we combined these data with current market values and hypothetical management regimes obtained from the literature for leaves and seeds. Conducting a quantitative analysis of 43 0.1ha plots with differences in forest and soil type, we assessed the abundance of C. seifrizzi in the area. We also conducted interviews to estimate the importance of xate in the local economy. We found C. seifrizii density to be highly variable, with a mean (±SE) of 295 (±35), with forest type being the most influential factor. Population structures differ between forest types, with healthy populations in medium and lower forest. We found a mean density of leaves of harvestable size of 3,750 (±380) leaves ha-1, while seed production was 1.5 (±0.3) kg/ha-1 of fresh seeds. Assuming sustainable harvest rates of 30-50% for leaves and 80% for seeds, one hectare of forest could generate USD 7.0-15.9/ha-1. Considering the number of households (102) and 10% of the total area managed each year (5,700 ha), this harvest could generate a household income of USD 391-838 annually. At the moment, xate trade represents a minor component in the economy of the community, but given the area's extensive forest (&gt;57,000 ha), the resource abundance, and the low human population, we believe the NTFPs derived from C. seifrizii have a potentially great economic impact in the area. © 2011 The New York Botanical Garden.","leaves and seed harvesting; NTFPs; Xate; Yucatan Peninsula","Arecaceae; Chamaedorea; Chamaedorea seifrizii","Lopez-Toledo, L.; Centro de Investigaciones en Ecosistemas, Apartado Postal 27-3 Xangari, 58089 Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico; email: llopez@oikos.unam.mx",,,00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

The focus of most current crop production practices is weed control with little effort applied by herbicides. Cropping practices that degrade soil and limit genetic diversity contribute to increasing weed populations. A field experiment was initiated at Malkandher Research Farm, NWFP (NorthWest Frontier Province) AgriculturalUniversity, Peshawar during Rabi 2005-2006 to figure out the tolerance of different wild oats (noxious weed) biotypes to herbicides. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design under a split-plot arrangement, with three replications. The experiment comprised of four wild oats biotypes assigned to the main plots, while 3 herbicides along with a weedy check (Sencor, Isoproturon, Affinity andWeedy check treatment) were kept in sub-plots. The Ghaznavi-98 variety of wheat in a sub-plot size of 5 × 1m2 was planted on November 13, 2005. The data were recorded on tillers plant-1, wheat spikes m-2, number of grains spike-1, 1,000 grain weight (g), biological yield (t ha-1), grain yield (t ha-1) and the protein content (%) in grain. The statistical analyses of data exhibited non-significant differences for tolerance of biotypes to herbicides in all the morphological and agronomic traits, while herbicides and their interaction with biotypeswere significant for all the traits examined except wheat plant height. As a consequence of phytotoxic effect on weeds, the herbicides increased grain yield and yield components. The herbicide Affinity out yielded rest of the herbicides. In general, the highest grain yield was harvested in Affinity treated plots across all the wild oats biotypes. The interaction of biotypes with the herbicides exhibited a differential competitive ability or tolerance to different herbicides. It is thus recommended that judicious thinking is desired to control different biotypes infesting farmers' fields because wild oat (Avena fatua L.) is one of the most troublesome weeds in the weed community. The Pakistani prairies are a semiarid region prone to soil erosion, and appears to be an appropriate site to adopt conservation tillage practices. Due to the environmental concerns and the development of herbicide resistance, it would be desirable to integrate all aspects of crop management systems, rather than solely rely on herbicides, to manage wild oat problems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.","Biotypes; Herbicides; Wild oat",,"Khan, I.; Department of Weed Science, , Peshawar 25130, Pakistan; email: imtiazagri@yahoo.com",,,18666280,9783540959908,,,"English","Environ.

Top U.S. officials have praised Pakistan for itsongoing cooperation, although long-held doubts exist about Islamabad'scommitment to some core U.S. interests. Pakistan is identified as a base forterrorist groups and their supporters operating in Kashmir, India, andAfghanistan. Since 2003, Pakistan's army has conducted unprecedented andlargely ineffectual counterterrorism operations in the country's FederallyAdministered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, where Al Qaedaoperatives and pro-Taliban insurgents are said to enjoy ""safe haven."" Militantgroups have only grown stronger and more aggressive in 2008. Islamabad'snew civilian-led government vows to combat militancy in the FATA through a combination of military force, negotiation with ""reconcilable"" elements, andeconomic development. The Pakistani military has in late 2008 undertakenmajor operations aimed at neutralizing armed extremism in the Bajaur agency,and the government is equipping local tribal militias in several FATA agencieswith the hope that these can supplement efforts to bring the region under moreeffective state writ.The upsurge of militant activity on the Pakistan side of the border isharming the U.S.-led stabilization mission in Afghanistan, by all accounts.U.S. commanders in Afghanistan attribute much of the deterioration insecurity conditions in the south and east over the past year to increasedmilitant infiltration from Pakistan. U.S. policymakers are putting in place aseries of steps to try to address the deficiencies of the Afghan government andother causes of support for Afghan Taliban militants, but they are alsoundertaking substantial new security measures to stop the infiltration.A key, according to U.S. commanders, is to reduce militant infiltrationinto Afghanistan from Pakistan. To do so, U.S. General David McKiernan, theoverall commander in Afghanistan, is ""redefining"" the Afghan battlefield toinclude the Pakistan border regions, and U.S. forces are becoming somewhatmore aggressive in trying to disrupt, from the Afghan side of the border,militant operational preparations and encampments on the Pakistani side of theborder. At the same time, Gen. McKiernan and other U.S. commanders aretrying to rebuild a stalled Afghanistan-Pakistan-U.S./NATO militarycoordination process, building intelligence and information sharing centers,and attempting to build greater trust among the senior ranks of the Pakistanimilitary.Islamist extremism and militancy has been a menace to Pakistani societythroughout the post-2001 period, becoming especially prevalent in 2007 and2008. The numerous militant groups operating in Pakistan, many of whichhave in the past displayed mutual animosity, may be increasing their levels ofcoordination and planning. Moreover, a new generation of militants iscomprised of battle-hardened jihadis with fewer allegiances to religious andtribal leaders and customs. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte warned inlate 2008 that, ""The United States and our allies face near-term challengesfrom Pakistan's reluctance and inability to roll back terrorist sanctuaries in thetribal region."" One Western press report called Pakistan's FederallyAdministered Tribal Areas (FATA) ""the most ungoverned, combustible regionin the world,"" and an unrelenting surge in Islamist-related violence in Pakistanhas some observers fearing a total collapse of the Pakistani state.1 This untenable state of affairs is compounded by Pakistan's deteriorating economicconditions.2In 2008, the influence of Islamist militants appears to have grownunchecked in large parts of Pakistan beyond the FATA, bringing insecurityeven to the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) capital of Peshawar, whichreportedly is in danger of being overrun by pro-Taliban militants. In late 2008,militants in the region have attempted to assassinate the U.S. Consul Generalin Peshawar and undertook the targeted killing of an American aid workerthere. Other so-called ""settled areas"" of Pakistan beyond the tribal regionshave come under attack from pro-Taliban militants. Indeed, the""Talibanization"" of western Pakistan appears to be ongoing and may nowthreaten the territorial integrity of the Pakistani state. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Case studies from the United States have focused on how these patterns lead to the cultural displacement and replacement of land-based livelihoods, including non-timber forest product (NTFP) practices. Scholars have also documented the persistence of culturally and economically important NTFP practices in urban and suburban areas. We reconcile these disparate outcomes, displacement on the one hand and persistence on the other, by focusing on the social relationships that co-produce land use and livelihood change. Our case investigates how African American sweetgrass basketmakers in Mount Pleasant South Carolina negotiate the complex terrain of a rapidly urbanizing and gentrifying landscape.Analysis of interviews with basketmakers and participant observation at public meetings suggests that gathering materials and selling baskets occur across spaces not typically considered important for NTFP practices. Access to these sites depends upon continually reinforced and negotiated social relationships between a variety of actors. Findings illustrate that, by themselves, development and gentrification are insufficient for explaining livelihood and land use patterns that emerge in places experiencing intensive development. Using a co-production framework, we acknowledge the wide variety of complex trajectories and local power dynamics shaping land use and livelihoods. Findings also have implications for connecting global research on housing, employment, and demographic transitions associated with rural gentrification, to international NTFP research, which is increasingly turning to rural-urban interfaces for insights on how livelihoods are linked to land development and migration. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Contemporary subsistence; Coproduction; Gullah; Non-timber forest products; Political ecology; South Carolina","coastal development; cultural tradition; demographic transition; employment; gentrification; land use change; nontimber forest product; rural-urban migration; urban area; urban housing; urbanization; South Carolina; United States; Hierochloe","Grabbatin, B.; Department of Geography, 1457 Patterson Office Tower, Lexington, KY 40506-0027, United States; email: bcgr222@uky.edu",,,00167185,,,,"English","Geoforum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052301298

Since nutrient-orientated EE measures are consistent with the materials balance principle, NTFP index is superior to other existing TFP indexes. An empirical study on the environmental performance of an agricultural sector in 30 OECD countries from 1990 to 2003 yielded several important findings. First, these countries should be able to produce current outputs with at least 50% less aggregate eutrophying power, implying that they should have been able to substantially reduce the potential for eutrophication. Second, traditional TFP has grown by 1.6% per annum due to technical progress; however, there are lags in the responses of several countries to this technical progress. Third, environmental TFP has grown at a slower rate than traditional TFP growth due to reductions in nutrient-orientated allocative efficiency. Finally, changes in input combinations could have significantly improved environmental efficiency and productivity. These findings favor policy interventions and faster technological transfer to improve environmental performance. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Environmental efficiency; Environmental productivity; Materials balance; Nutrient efficiency; OECD agriculture","Agricultural sector; Allocative efficiency; Balance principle; Current output; Empirical studies; Environmental efficiency; Environmental factors; Environmental performance; Environmental productivity; OECD agriculture; OECD countries; Policy intervention; Technical progress; Technological transfer; Total factor productivity; Efficiency; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Productivity; Nutrients; agri-environmental policy; agricultural production; empirical analysis; environmental assessment; environmental economics; environmental factor; growth rate; nutrient budget; OECD; policy analysis; technology transfer; total factor productivity","Hoang, V.-N.; Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane QLD 4000, Australia; email: vincent.hoang@qut.edu.au",,,00950696,,JEEMD,,"English","J.

In the Pacific Northwest region of the US, the implementation of the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) in 1993 established a regional socioecological system focused on forest management. The NWFP resulted in a large (82%) decrease in the rate of harvest removals on public forest land, thus significantly impacting the regional carbon balance. Here we use a combination of remote sensing and ecosystem modeling to examine the trends in NEP and net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) in this region over the 1985-2007 period, with particular attention to land ownership since management now differs widely between public and private forestland. In the late 1980s, forestland in both ownership classes was subject to high rates of harvesting, and consequently the land was a carbon source (i.e. had a negative NECB). After the policy driven reduction in the harvest level, public forestland became a large carbon sink - driven in part by increasing NEP - whereas private forestland was close to carbon neutral. In the 2003-2007 period, the trend towards carbon accumulation on public lands continued despite a moderate increase in the extent of wildfire. The NWFP was originally implemented in the context of biodiversity conservation, but its consequences in terms of carbon sequestration are also of societal interest. Ultimately, management within the NWFP socioecological system will have to consider trade-offs among these and other ecosystem services. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Net ecosystem production; Pacific Northwest Forest Plan; Regional; Socioecological system","Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Net ecosystem production; Pacific Northwest; Regional; Socioecological system; Biodiversity; Conservation; Forestry; Harvesting; Remote sensing; Ecosystems; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; carbon balance; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; decadal variation; ecosystem modeling; ecosystem service; forest management; harvesting; net ecosystem production; policy making; remote sensing; trade-off; wildfire; Biodiversity; Carbon; Chelation; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Harvesting; Remote Sensing; Pacific Northwest","Turner, D.P.; Forest Ecosystems and Society, , Corvallis, OR 97331-7501, United States; email: david.turner@oregonstate.edu",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Consequently, market deregulation for agriculture and other natural products has been advocated to improve market efficiencies, participation and returns for the producers and local traders. The study examines the impact of deregulation of state marketing controls on collection, sale and returns to extractors and traders from non-timber forest products. It assessed whether deregulation policy resulted in greater benefits to primary extractors and a win-win situation for both producers and traders? Mixed effects were found, with no significant changes in terms of trade, demand, or quantum of consumption; but there was an overall increase in the procurement price for several products following deregulation. The collection and farm gate price of tree based oilseeds and honey increased due to lower transaction costs, and ease of trading with a continued demand for these products. The impact on less valuable products was insignificant. Abolition of monopolistic trading increased competition and had a pull effect on the local market prices of several NTFPs. Although traders paid a higher price to procure products, overall they also benefited being able to sell the purchased products to merchants and manufacturers at a better margin than previously. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Deregulation; Forest governance; Livelihood; Non-timber forest products; NTFP markets; Traders","Forest governance; Livelihood; Non-timber forest products; NTFP markets; Traders; Commerce; Competition; Costs; Forestry; Marketing; Raw materials; Timber; Deregulation; Commerce; Competition; Control Systems; Costs; Forest Products; Forests; India; Marketing; Raw Materials","Mahapatra, A.K.; Forest and Environment Department, , Bhubaneswar, Orissa 751015, India; email: otelp@rediffmail.com",,,13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

We report on group discussions and household interviews in two South African villages to assess the frequency and nature of shocks and stresses over a 2-year period and the coping strategies employed, stratified by household wealth and gender of the de jure household head. Overall, kinship was the most widely adopted coping strategy, and NTFPs were the fifth most prevalent (employed by 70% of households). There were relatively few differences in the nature of shocks or responses between male-and female-headed households. Wealth influenced the experience of shocks or stresses as well as responses. Poorer households have fewer options with the increased use or sale of NTFPs being the second most commonly adopted strategy. Increased use and sale of NTFPs is a common manifestation of the safety-net function.

Group marketing has often been cited as one way through which farmers can increase their access to markets by improving their negotiation/bargaining power and the competitiveness of their production as well as reduce transaction costs. However, these suppositions need to be verified especially as some of them are solely based on theory. This study uses data on producers' perceptions of expected benefits attainment through group sale initiatives to analyse the case of two NTFP producer groups in Cameroon. Results show that by joining groups, farmers can reduce some transaction costs while other costs may increase. Although overall negotiation power may increase following interventions from group activities, certain elements of negotiation are fundamental to success like bargaining better prices commensurate to efforts put in by members to meet quality standards set by traders. By using transaction cost theory, the study identifies certain elements hidden in the attributes of the transactions between producer groups and traders such as the nature of products and roads, or dispersed settlement of producers that may frustrate group market initiatives and may account for differences in performance between one group and another. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cameroon; Group marketing; Non Timber Forest Products; Transaction costs","Cameroon; Dispersed settlement; Group activities; Group marketing; Market arrangements; Market performance; Non-timber forest products; Quality standard; Transaction cost; Transaction cost analysis; Transaction-cost theory; Agriculture; Commerce; Competition; Cost accounting; Cost reduction; Marketing; Timber; Cost benefit analysis","Foundjem Tita, D.; World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF-AHT), P.O.

Main factors determining the populations of NTFP-providing species are human activities. This study examined the impact of land-use, combined with rates and patterns of debarking and chopping on a NTFP-providing tree (Anogeissus leiocarpa) in Burkina Faso. We compared stands in a protected area (W National Park) with those of its surrounding communal area (fallows, croplands) in order to (i) obtain an indication on the status of the population, (ii) assess its harvesting tolerance, (iii) estimate the sustainability of present management, and (iv) derive which additional management strategies may foster its conservation. Our results reveal that the stands of A. leiocarpa are in healthy states in fallows and in the park. In croplands, the absence of saplings gives evidence of a declining population. Nearly all individuals of A. leiocarpa were harvested in croplands and fallows, while the number of harvested individuals in the park was negligible. Intensity of debarking and chopping was tree size-specific. The sprouting ability significantly increased with higher chopping intensity. We conclude that despite the land-use impact and the intense harvesting, stands of A. leiocarpa are still well preserved due to the species life history (fast growing and high sprouting) and due to indirect positive influences of human activities by providing better environmental conditions for its recruitment. Thus, the population of A. leiocarpa is not at risk to over-harvesting and land-use even though it is not protected. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Anogeissus leiocarpa; Burkina Faso; National Park; Sprouting; Sustainable use","agricultural land; conservation management; dicotyledon; environmental conditions; fallow; harvesting; human activity; land use change; life history; national park; nontimber forest product; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); sapling; savanna; semiarid region; sustainability; tropical region; Burkina Faso; Anogeissus leiocarpa","Schumann, K.; J.W.

As both species have important timber and non-timber uses, for each species we compare regeneration parameters among different management scenarios (sites used for timber logging, non-timber product extraction, and undisturbed forests). Results suggest that both species share similar natural regeneration characteristics. These include temporally and spatially asynchronous germination, existence of individuals that have more abundant and frequent fruit production than the average of the population and a positive influence of the mother tree crown on seedling and sapling density. The management activities analyzed did not influence the regeneration parameters of both species, which suggests that timber logging the way it was performed and current rates of D. odorata seed gathering and C. reticulata tapping at the study site are not sufficiently intense to threaten species population. However, some species characteristics, such as their reproductive strategies, light-demanding syndromes, low-dispersal ranges, and high-mortality rates of seedlings make both species vulnerable to exploitation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Amazonia; Copaifera reticulata; Dipteryx odorata; NTFP extraction; Timber logging","fruit production; germination; growth rate; logging (timber); mortality; Neotropical Region; population density; recruitment (population dynamics); sapling; vulnerability; Amazonia; Copaifera reticulata; Dipteryx odorata","Herrero-Jáuregui, C.; Departamento de Ecología, Facultad de Biología, Calle José Antonio Novais s/n, 28040 Madrid, Spain; email: crherrero@bio.ucm.es",,,13850237,,PLECF,,"English","Plant Ecol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961031120

Between Dec.2008 and Aug.2009 intensive camera-trapping was conducted within mosaic deciduous dipterocarp and mixeddeciduous/semi-evergreen forest in the east of Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary, Mondulkiri province, Cambodia. Forty camera-trap locations were set up for >2700 camera-trap nights producing 707 independent encounters of 23 mammal species. Eight globally threatened species of mammals were recorded including the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), banteng (Bos javanicus) and dhole (Cuon alpinus). Two species, the gaur (Bos gaurus) and pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), showed significant preference for forest type (higher Relative Abundance Index of both species in mixed-deciduous/semi-evergreen forest). The mix of drier deciduous dipterocarp forest and wetter mixed-deciduous and semi-evergreen forest appears important for maintaining the conservation value of the site. Camera trap encounter rates were lower in areas within a day's walk from villages at the periphery of the protected area whilst cathemeral species displayed higher proportions of nocturnal activity than in similar studies from elsewhere in South-east Asia. We suggest disturbance and hunting may therefore be affecting the distribution and activity patterns of key species. Managing the Non Timber Forest Product (NTFP) collectors as well as finalising, and enforcing, zonation within the protected area are recommended conservation measures for the mammal community. © National University of Singapore.","Camera-trap; Deciduous dipterocarp forest; Human disturbance; Indochina; Wild cattle","Bos; Bos gaurus; Bos javanicus; Cuon alpinus; Elephas maximus; Macaca; Macaca nemestrina; Mammalia; Suidae","Gray, T.

For NTFP, knowledge about how the sustainability of harvest varies by plant life-form and part harvested is limited and needed to inform management of the thousands of species providing income to millions of people world-wide. Matrix population models are commonly used to generate management recommendations. We reviewed studies of 46 NTFP species that used matrix models and synthesize the current knowledge on harvest effects. For 19 species with harvested and control populations, we assessed the impacts of harvest on projected population growth rates (λ) using meta-analysis and analysed trends in population responses to harvest across species, life-forms and plant part harvested using elasticity and life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses, and the combination of both, to assess vulnerability to harvest. NTFP harvest significantly reduced λ across species. On the scale of individual studies, however, λ provided little information about harvest sustainability unless replication was sufficiently high. Most studies had low levels of replication over space or time and did not include contrasting levels of harvest. Whole-plant harvest of herbs and bark harvest from trees were not sustainable largely because of decreases in survival. Palm leaf or fruit harvest and rattan stem harvest were potentially sustainable. Combined elasticity-LTRE analysis was especially valuable in assessing the sustainability of harvest when differences in λ between harvested and control populations were small, for studies with limited replicates, and where harvest effects varied regionally. Synthesis and applications. The use of matrix models to assess the impacts of NTFP harvest is still rare in regions where trade of wild plants is heaviest and for several commonly harvested life-forms. Given the high variance in estimates for most NTFP species, λ does not provide a precise assessment of harvest impacts. We recommend that managers consider the combined elasticity-LTRE analysis in addition to λ in making management decisions for NTFP. NTFP research that accounts for environmental drivers of population dynamics in addition to harvest should be prioritized. © 2011 The Authors.

It has been increasingly recognized that promoting the use, production and sustainable harvesting of such kinds of products could also contribute to forest conservation in the long run. However, since the development process has progressed in most regions, alternatives or substitutes of such products have become available on the markets, and it will be difficult for these nature-based products to exist without additional product values. A market survey was conducted in an urban fringe of north-eastern Bangladesh to investigate NTFP-based product diversity, and marketing patterns and challenges. Further information was collected from sellers and consumers to understand their views on probable future strategies to sustain the markets of these products. A total of 38 NTFP and NTFP-based secondary products were recorded from 25 NTFP shops, including 16 permanent, 7 temporary (or semi-permanent) and 2 mobile shops. The greatest demand was observed for bamboo and cane-based products, for which supply suffered due to the scarcity of raw materials. A decreasing trend in the consumption of NTFP-based articles for urban domestic use was also reported from the sellers. To cope with the competitive markets, sellers were found to place more emphasis on creative marketing, durability and appearance of their products. The study concluded that active government support is needed for the sustenance of this industry in a changing global perspective. This could be in the form of technical advancement in the production process, improvement of existing product supply chains and skill development of the workers which will not only secure the future of these products but also provide an essential means for the survival of this industry and for thousands of people living from it. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Competition; Consumers' preference; Market promotion; Substitute goods; Sylhet","competition (economics); conservation; consumption behavior; harvesting; marketing; nontimber forest product; urban area; Bangladesh","Mukul, S.

To define sustainable harvest limits it is critical to understand the biological impacts of harvest. In the last decade we have improved our understanding of the demographic mechanisms driving population level responses to harvest. Our understanding of the ecophysiological underpinnings for these processes is still limited. We tested the effect of foliage harvest by indigenous Fulani people on leaf stoichiometry and economics in Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) in two vegetation types (fallows vs. forest) and in two ecological regions (dry vs. moist) in Benin, West Africa. Leaf mass per area (LMA) increased with aridity. Across sites and treatments, LMA correlated negatively with nitrogen and phosphorus per mass (Nmass and Pmass respectively), more strongly than with concentrations per area (Narea and Parea respectively) consistent with world-wide trends in leaf economics. The effect of foliage harvest on foliar nutrient concentrations was dependent on plant size and habitat. Harvesting increased Nmass and Pmass in larger trees, and altered the LMA-Nmass relationship between vegetation types and the LMA-Parea relationship between ecological regions, but it did not affect stoichiometry (N:P or C:N ratios). Synthesis and applications. The context-dependent effect of harvest on leaf economics emphasizes the importance of considering plant size and climate in predicting the biological consequences of NTFP harvest, and explains some of the ecophysiological mechanisms underlying demographic responses to harvest. The plant size- and climate-dependent effects of harvest on leaf composition suggest a different approach for assessing the impact of NTFP harvest on population dynamics. NTFP harvest should be modelled explicitly as a size dependent factor and integral projection models provide the framework for this. Our findings suggest that to reduce harvesting pressure on wild populations, it is important to encourage Fulani owned K. senegalensis plantations, especially in the dry region where harvest had greater effects. © 2011 The Authors.

Soil factors significantly influenced tree species composition, although they only explained 5.7% of the observed data variance. Human factors (disturbance) were second most important in explaining species composition and density, accounting for 4.4% of variance. Changes in species composition related to human disturbance varied mostly independently of soils. The species composition of slightly and heavily disturbed forest differed significantly, with species of low conservation value being most common in heavily disturbed forest, while endangered species and important timber trees were most common in least disturbed forest. Density of treelets was higher in limestone forest than in non-limestone forest. Timber trees and other useful plant species used for a whole range of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) were more abundant in the less disturbed plots, which were located far away from villages and roads. Basal area in less disturbed forest was also larger than in heavily disturbed forest, indicating that the pressures of illegal logging and harvesting were closely connected to travel distances to nearest villages. Limiting the accessibility to forest resources should therefore be a priority in forest conservation as a first step to safeguard the rich biodiversity and stocks of useful plants in the park. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia.","Biodiversity conservation; Disturbance; Human impact; Illegal logging; Soils","Basal area; Biodiversity conservation; Disturbance; Endangered species; Environmental influences; Forest conservation; Forest plots; Forest resources; Human disturbances; Human impact; Illegal logging; Low conservation; National parks; Non-timber forest products; Observed data; Physical environments; Plant diversity; Plant species; Soil factors; Species composition; Travel distance; Tree species composition; Viet Nam; Biodiversity; Conservation; Crime; Human engineering; Limestone; Logging (forestry); Plant extracts; Soils; Timber; Parks; anthropogenic effect; basal area; biodiversity; community composition; endangered species; habitat conservation; harvesting; logging (timber); population density; Biodiversity; Conservation; Extractives; Forests; Human Engineering; Lime Stone; Logging; Plants; Soil; Vietnam; Ben En National Park; Viet Nam","Hoang, V.S.; Biodiversity Centre, , Xuan Mai, Hanoi, Viet Nam; email: hoangvsam@yahoo.com",,,01281283,,JTFSE,,"English","J Trop Forest Sci",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960761073

However, most studies have failed to account for temporal and spatial variability in the ecological conditions in which these species occur, as well as variability in the patterns of harvest intensity. In reality, local harvesters harvest at variable rather than fixed intensity over time. Here we used Markov chains to investigate how different patterns of harvesting intensity (summarized as return time to high harvest) affected the stochastic population growth rate (λ s) and its elasticity to perturbation of means and variances of vital rates. We studied the effect of bark and foliage harvest from African mahogany Khaya senegalensis in two contrasting ecological regions in Benin. Khaya populations declined regardless of time between harvests of high intensity. Moreover, λ s increased with decreasing harvesting pressure in the dry region but, surprisingly, declined in the moist region toward λ s = 0.956. The stochastic elasticity was dominated by the stasis of juveniles and adults. The declining growth rate with decreasing harvest pressure in the moist region was mainly driven by the declining mean survival rates of juveniles and adults. Our results suggest that modeling the temporal variability of harvest intensity as a Markov chain better mimics local practices and provides insights that are missed when temporal variability in harvest intensity is modeled as independent over time and drawn from a fixed distribution. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.","African mahogany; Benin, West Africa; Contrasting ecological conditions; Effect of NTFP harvest; Environment-specific elasticity; Harvest return time; Khaya senegalensis; Markov chain; Matrix models; Stochastic elasticity; Tropical trees","evergreen tree; forestry modeling; growth rate; harvesting; Markov chain; nontimber forest product; population decline; population distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; species occurrence; stochasticity; survival; timber harvesting; variance analysis; wild population; article; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; forestry; Meliaceae; methodology; physiology; population dynamics; statistical model; statistics; theoretical model; tree; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Meliaceae; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Population Dynamics; Stochastic Processes; Trees; Benin [West Africa]; Khaya; Khaya senegalensis; Swietenia","Gaoue, O.G.; Department of Biology, , Coral Gables, FL 33146, United States; email: ogaoue@bio.miami.edu",,,10510761,,ECAPE,"21830705","English","Ecol.

This research study was planned to investigate the immunomodulatory and growth promoting effect of milk thistle as feed additive against aflatoxin B 1 in broiler chicks at NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan. Two hundred and forty (240) day old broilers chicks were randomly assigned into four major groups AfF, aflatoxin free feed; Aflatoxin B 1 was present in the feed at the levels of 80-520 μg/kg of the feed in the remaining three groups. Aflatoxin contaminated feed was provided for 5 weeks. Group AfB was supplemented with toxin binder ""Mycoad"" at 3 g/kg of feed and group AfT was supplemented with milk thistle at10 g/kg of feed. Each group was further sub divided into two sub-groups, vaccinated against ND (Newcastle disease), IB (Infectious bronchitis) and IBD (Infectious bursal diseases) according to recommended schedule of vaccination or non vaccinated. Each sub group carried three replicates with 10 chicks per replicate. Chicks were reared in pens in an open sided house. Supplementary heat was provided to all the chicks during brooding period. Mean body weight gain and dressing percentage were significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in group AfF, followed by AfT, AfB and Af. Weight gain and dressing percentage was the same in group AfB and AfT, while it was significantly lower in group Af. Feed intake, breast, thigh and leg weight were found significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in group AfF, followed by AfB, AfT and Af. Significantly lower (better) FCR value was recorded in group AfT. Water intake was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in group AfT and AfF as compared to other groups. Mortality was significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher in group Af.

Palms are important NTFPs, providing numerous products, including leaves. The harvest of palm leaves rarely results in the immediate death of individuals and can be considered one example of the sustainable use of forest resources. However, in most cases basic ecological information, such as distribution and abundance of the species is unknown, as is information on the ecological implications of human impacts, such as leaf harvest and livestock grazing. In the tropical dry forests of northwest Mexico, leaves from the threatened palm Brahea aculeata are harvested for roofing material and represent an important NTFP. In this study, we assessed the distribution and abundance patterns of this species across 52 plots in the tropical dry forest of Sierra de Álamos-Rio Cuchujaqui Reserve (SARCR) in Sonora, Mexico. We also evaluated patterns of leaf harvest and cattle browse intensity on palm populations. We found that B. aculeata density is highly variable across the landscape with a mean (±SE) of 121.7±36.3ha-1. Results indicate that B. aculeata is primarily distributed near to arroyos and rivers. The highest densities were found in sites with low incidence radiation (&lt;0.06MJcm-2) and narrow stream width of arroyos/rivers (&lt;9.5m). Palm abundance also varied within the plots, and B. aculeata attained its highest densities near to the arroyo edge (first 20m from the edge), perhaps indicating a microhabitat effect on palm demography. Overall, fewer than 6% of the stems were seedlings. Leaf harvesting and browsing appear to affect demographic vital rates of the species; specifically we found a significant effect of harvesting and browsing activity on the proportion of reproductive active adults. Thus, low levels of seedlings in the populations may be the result of reduced fruit production by adults and higher mortality rates of seedlings due to livestock herbivory. Result from interviews with land owners also indicated that past land use, especially along arroyos might also have important impacts on the observed distribution, low densities and absence of recruitment in some areas. We believe current distribution and abundance of NTFP, such as B. aculeata at SARCR may be a result of combined effects of environmental factors and human impacts. Results from this study will be used to develop appropriate conservation, management and restoration plans of B. aculeata in the area. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cattle browsing; IUCN Red List; Leaves harvesting; Microhabitat preference; NTFP","Cattle browsing; IUCN Red List; Leaves harvesting; Microhabitats; NTFP; Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Harvesting; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Regional planning; Rural areas; Seed; Tropics; Population distribution; abundance; anthropogenic effect; browsing; cattle; conservation management; demography; dry forest; endangered species; environmental factor; forest resource; fruit; harvesting; herbivory; livestock; livestock farming; microhabitat; monocotyledon; mortality; natural resource; nontimber forest product; population density; population distribution; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); Red List; restoration ecology; rural development; sustainable development; tropical forest; Mexico [North America]; Sonora; Aculeata; Bos","Lopez-Toledo, L.; Division of Applied Plant Ecology, 15600 San Pasqual Valley Road, Escondido, CA 92027, United States; email: llopez-toledo@sandiegozoo.org",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Pandanus guillaumetii B. C. Stone is endemic to the east coast rainforests of Madagascar. The plant is an important non-timber forest product (NTFP) for the local population living near these forests, and its leaves are collected by women to be woven into mats. These mats have economic value and are also used for daily activities. At present, little is known about how local harvesting practices impact this plant species. In this study, we describe women's local harvest practices and quantify their impact on the P. guillaumetii population. We carried out plant inventories as well as interviews and participatory observations with local people harvesting P. guillaumetii in two villages with different population densities in the Manompana region. Inventories were conducted at varying distances from the villages in order to better understand the influence of human pressure on the plant population. The results suggest that local communities apply practices that tend to minimize the harvest impact on the plant. Harvesting seems to have no effect on the actual density of P. guillaumetii. However, the availability of plants with leaves of sufficient quality for mat production is influenced by human pressure. Considering the decreasing number of plants suitable for handicraft, we assume that their availability in the long term may not fulfill the needs of the local people. © 2011 The New York Botanical Garden.","harvest impact; harvest practices; leaf harvest; Madagascar; non-timber forest product; Pandanus","Pandanus","Lea Urech, Z.

Although the abundance and popularity of this species in Cerrado have been an important component of local extractive economy, several aspects of sustainability as fruit production per tree size and growth rate have received little attention. We monitored, during two growing seasons, the stem growth rates and fruit production of tree in a wild population in Distrito Federal, central Brazil. The results showed a low growth rate of trees. The proportion of adult population fruiting was higher in 2006 than in 2007. For the smallest size (7.3-cm stem diameter) to begin fruiting, the estimated age was between 30 and 51 years old, and for tree with the largest stem diameter in the plot (43-cm diameter) the age was estimated to be between 110 and 153 years old. The whole fruit production by hectare was highly variable between years and was associated with differences in annual precipitation. The total fruit production was 1,004 fruits per ha (72.9 kg ha-1) in 2006, and 299 fruits per ha (21.7 kg ha-1) in 2007. The fruit production per tree was significantly positively correlated between 2006 and 2007 fruit season. Although an estimated fruit yield for whole Cerrado region is more than enough to support the actual demand, the slow growth rates and intensive harvesting indicates that more attention to sustainable management is required to avert demographic collapse of this cornerstone of the Cerrado extractive economy. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Exploration; Fruit production; NTFP; Savanna; Tree growth rate","abundance; agroforestry; biome; cerrado; crop yield; diameter; economic impact; fruit production; growing season; growth rate; monitoring system; native species; precipitation (climatology); rural population; savanna; stem; sustainability; Brazil; Federal District [Brazil]; Caryocar brasiliense","Henriques, R.

Material and methods: Ethnobotanical data was collected using freelisting interviews with randomly selected informants and semi-structured as well as field interviews. Plant specimens were collected, identified and deposited at the Herbarium of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Mengla, Yunnan Province, China. Data were analysed by use-reports, in addition important indices like relative frequency of citation (RFC) and cultural importance index (CI) were calculated. Smith's salience index was assessed using Anthropac 4.08. Consensus analysis was applied to measure informant agreement on plants used in different medicinal use categories. Results: A total of 199 medicinal plants belonging to 73 families were recorded. Dominant families are Asteraceae (5.5%), Piperaceae and Verbenaceae (4.5%), Fabaceae, Liliaceae (4.0%) and Euphorbiaceae, Lamiaceae and Solanaceae (3.5%). Most culturally salient species from freelisting analysis were Dendrobium crepidatum Lindl. ex Paxt. (Smith's SI = 0.41), Aristolochia sp. (0.306), Microstegium ciliatum (Trin.) A. Camus (0.129), Eupatorium coelestinum L. (0.119), Litsea martabanica (Kurz) Hook. F. (0.116) and Psidium guajava L. (0.103). The majority of the utilised species were collected from forest (51.9%), followed by fallow land (22.52%), arable fields (14.5%), and homegardens (11.08%). Conclusions: It became clear that the knowledge of medicinal plants is not homogenously distributed among Hani. Based on the percentage of collected medicinal plants from four habitat types, forest is the most important source of medicinal plants for Hani but when considering the cultural importance of species it seems that homegardens are slightly more important than other habitats. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Bioeconomy; Ethnobotany; Hani minority; Medicinal plant; NTFP","Acorus calamus extract; Adhatoda vasica extract; alocasia extract; Amaranthus viridis extract; baphicacanthus cusia extract; caryota monostachys extract; Centella asiatica extract; curculigo capitulata extract; deeringia amaranthoides extract; eleutherococcus trifoliatus extract; Eryngium foetidum extract; fissistigma acuminatissimum extract; gendarussa ventricosa extract; ilex tephrophylla extract; iresine herbstii extract; lepidagathis incurva extract; Mangifera indica extract; plant extract; pothos repens extract; rauvolfia verticillata extract; rhaphidophora decursiva extract; rhaphidophora hongkongensis extract; rhaphidophora lancifolia extract; rhus chinensis extract; saurauia cerea extract; saurauia punduana extract; schefflera brevipedicellata extract; steudnera colocasiifolia extact; trevesia palmata extract; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; angiosperm; Aristolochia; arthralgia; arthritis; article; Asteraceae; bite; bone injury; China; diarrhea; dysuria; economic aspect; ethnicity; ethnobotany; eupatorium coelestinum; Euphorbia; food poisoning; forest; fracture; guava; headache; human; hypertension; indigestion; land use; legume; litsea martabanica; medicinal plant; microstegium ciliatum; minority group; nephrolithiasis; nonhuman; pain; Piperaceae; rheumatic disease; semi structured interview; species difference; stomach pain; tracheitis; Verbenaceae; watershed; China; Ethnobotany; Geography; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Plants, Medicinal; Species Specificity; Aristolochia; Asteraceae; Dendrobium crepidatum; Eupatorium coelestinum; Euphorbiaceae; Fabaceae; Lamiaceae; Liliaceae; Litsea martabanica; Microstegium; Piperaceae; Psidium guajava; Solanaceae; Verbenaceae","Ghorbani, A.; University of Hohenheim, Garbenstraße 13, 70599 Stuttgart, Germany; email: ghorbani@uni-hohenheim.de",,,03788741,,JOETD,"21251966","English","J.

This study examined the feasibility of xate commercialization and certification at the scale of the extractor livelihood system in an ejido in the Chinantla region of Oaxaca, Mexico. Ethnographic methods were used to collect livelihood system data. These data were used to develop an ethnographic linear program (ELP) model of extractor households to analyze the effects of palm frond management and marketing scenarios on their livelihoods. Three necessary conditions for the feasibility of certification were hypothesized: two related to extractor livelihoods and another related to market fluidity. Livelihood outcomes supported the notion that resource sustainability and economic development are not mutually exclusive, and provided support for xate certification as an intervention oriented toward the integration of these objectives. In contrast, the model revealed an unfavorable discrepancy between xate supply and the level of demand expressed by an interested buyer. This shortfall represented a substantial obstacle to the feasibility of xate certification in the community. Low demand fulfillment suggested that xate certification ultimately represents an infeasible strategy for the community, irrespective of the observed livelihood and conservation benefits. Results highlighted the importance of understanding household objectives and market context in local decisions to pursue NTFP certification. We suggest that the community's objectives would best be served by engaging neighboring communities in a cooperative and controlled effort to augment regional supply. © 2010 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Certification; Chamaedorea; Livelihoods; NTFP; Oaxaca; Palm; Scenario model; Xate","certification; commercialization; conservation planning; economic development; forest management; nontimber forest product; Mexico [North America]; Oaxaca; Chamaedorea","Wilsey, D.

We studied the population dynamics of this stoloniferous palm in Colombian Amazonia, using ramet-based Lefkovitch matrices, and assessed the impact of leaf harvest on population structure and dynamics, through experimental defoliation. Leaf production rate of unharvested palms ranged between 0.93 leaves per year in seedlings and 1.71 in adults. Vegetative shoots produced through stolons are more important than seedlings for maintaining the population; stolons act also as a reserve to overcome damage in the population. The potential population growth rate was 8.3% per year (λ = 1.083). Juveniles had the highest contribution to population growth, and permanence was the most important life parameter. Thus, harvest of leaves for thatching can jeopardize the population if juveniles are also harvested. An initial harvest intensity of more than 50% of the leaves in a crown, or leaving the palm with fewer than four leaves, would have a negative impact on leaf production. Although matrix modeling suggests that all adult ramets can be harvested, this must be taken with caution, as clonal integration may play an important role in population dynamics. Long-term harvest of Lepidocaryum leaves is possible, if plots are harvested in turns of four years, thus allowing palms to recover from the previous harvest. A better control on the quality of the braided tiles sold in the market would also ensure their longer duration, thus reducing the pressure on the resource. © Jaime A.

The rehabilitation and modernization of the USC was undertaken with a view to overcoming the shortage of water supplies for irrigation. The water allowance was enhanced from 0.39 to 0.77 Ls-1 ha-1 in the study area. Recently, the operation and management of a secondary canal or 'distributary' was transferred to the Farmers Organization (FO). This distributary named 'Chowki' offtakes from the Maira Branch of the USC. The cultivable command area (CCA) of this distributary is 4,306 ha and it serves 1,485 beneficiaries. A management committee on Chowki Distributary was formed in 2003. This distributary consists of one main and two minor channels having twenty-eight direct outlets. The Simulation of Irrigation Canal (SIC) hydrodynamic model was used to evaluate the flexibility of Chowki Distributary. The model was calibrated at 100, 80 and 70% of the design discharge (Qd) and it was validated at 90, 85 and 60% of the design discharge. The observed and simulated water levels were in close agreement with each other for the calibration and validation periods. The statistical analysis and paired t-test indicate that the model results are not statistically different from the measured values at 1% significance level. The simulated results of the SIC model were applied to studying flexibility of the outlet structures along the Chowki Distributary. The flexibility analysis demonstrates that poor performance is inbuilt into the system due to inadequate control over the accuracy of the crest setting during the construction of the outlets. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",,"Design discharge; Flexibility analysis; Hydrodynamic model; Model results; Operation and management; Outlet structures; Pakistan; Poor performance; Simulated results; Statistical analysis; Study areas; Validation periods; Computer simulation; Fluid dynamics; Hydraulic structures; Hydrodynamics; Irrigation; Irrigation canals; Water levels; Water supply; Structural design; calibration; canal; discharge; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; irrigation system; model validation; statistical application; water availability; water supply","Tariq, J.

The aim of the work has been to analyse a number of selected case studies within the theoretical framework developed by Varamäki and Vesalainen (2003) in order to demonstrate the relevance of networks in NWFP&S development. In the Mediterranean region, high population density, poverty and low wood productivity of forests have traditionally stimulated an intensive use of all potentially available sources of food, fodder and raw materials. In northern Europe, there is also a strong culture of utilizing forest products and, especially with the recent crises in the wood industry, interest in other uses of forests has increased. The enterprises dealing with NWFP&S are typically small or micro-sized and usually, except in a few cases, the turnover generated by the harvest, production, processing and/or commercialization of NWFP&S is quite limited. In this context, it is fairly evident that the creation of networks among NWFP&S producers, traders or sellers, or with other larger enterprises, can be a successful business strategy leading to positive economic results. The four case studies analysed in the chapter provide evidence supporting this idea. They concern both single-product/-service and multi-product/-service networks and, furthermore, they examine different evolutionary stages (from 'development circle' to 'project group'). These different case studies show which can be the role played by network structures in supporting innovation in NWFP&S marketing initiatives. In fact, it can be concluded that analysed networks: have been able to compensate for the traditional problems that micro-enterprises and small and medium enterprises may face in introducing innovations; can facilitate access to public funding and also to a key development factor such as forest land availability; or they can help in increasing the visibility of the sector. © CAB International 2011.

Head lice infestation is an infection of the scalp and skin which causes blood loss, discomfort, and social and psychological distress with the possibility of secondary bacterial infections occurring at scratch sites. In Pakistan, although some small scale studies have been conducted to investigate prevalence of head lice in school children and the general population, no population based estimates have been reported. The National Health Survey of Pakistan (NHSP 1990 - 94) was a nationally representative health examination survey of the Pakistani population. The NHSP is the first population based household survey to collect data on the prevalence of head lice in adult women in Pakistan. In this paper we use data from the NHSP to present an epidemiological profile of personal hygiene practices and head lice infestation among women aged 12 years or older in three provinces of Pakistan; Balochistan, Sindh and North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Results. Overall about 7% women aged 12 years and older suffered from head lice infestation. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified factors independently associated with presence of head lice. Age less than 16 years and crowding at home were associated with higher infestation-rates. The impact of household socio-economic status on infestation rates among women was different in urban and rural settings; urban women with low socio-economic status were more vulnerable than similar women in rural settings. Bathing infrequently in summer was associated with higher prevalence rates only in Sindh, possibly due to the fact that among the three provinces Sindh has a hotter and more humid summer. Conclusions. The results of our analysis of NHSP indicate high levels of head lice infestation among girls and women in the three Provinces. The epidemiological profile of hygienic practices of women indicated that NWFP and Balochistan as compared to Sindh, and rural as compared to urban areas were less developed with respect to access to water supply and soap for maintaining personal hygiene. Simple and cost-effective measures such as provision of water and soap, and improving awareness regarding maintaining personal hygiene can contribute significantly towards improving public health status of the women in Pakistan. © 2011 Mahmud et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adolescent; adult; article; bath; child; female; health survey; human; major clinical study; Pakistan; pediculosis capitis; personal hygiene; prevalence; rural area; school child; social status; summer; urban area; aged; animal; growth, development and aging; hygiene; middle aged; Pakistan; parasitology; pediculosis; Pediculus; risk factor; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pediculus humanus; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Hygiene; Lice Infestations; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Pediculus; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Young Adult","Mahmud, S.; Department of Community Health Sciences, Stadium Road, 74800 Karachi, Pakistan; email: sadia.mahmud@aku.edu",,,17563305,,,"21288357","English","Parasites Vectors",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251618773

This case study, undertaken in two villages in the Central Himalayan foot hills in Nepal, documents the absolute and relative importance of commercial NTFPs to rural household economies. Data were collected in a one-year period and included interviews with 250 households using a semi-structured questionnaire and monthly interviews with four sub-local NTFP traders, two local traders and two central wholesalers. The conservative estimate of NTFP-derived cash income showed this to be a cornerstone in poorer household livelihood strategies and thus in poverty prevention. An annual average of 578 kg of commercial NTFPs was collected in the wild per household, providing poorer households with a cash income share of 44-78%. Better off households are not NTFP dependent but rely on income from crop production and livestock. Based on a net marketing margin analysis, showing that harvesters capture a large share of the Indian wholesaler price, it is argued that there is scope for pursuing NTFP-based strategies for poverty reduction through leasehold forestry and agroforestry. Both these options are compatible with conserving forest cover and forest corridor functions and may thus present a win-win scenario for livelihood improvement and conservation. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Chepang; Conservation; Marketing margins; Nepal; Non-timber forest products; Poverty prevention","agricultural production; agroforestry; conservation management; forest management; household energy; nontimber forest product; poverty; questionnaire survey; rural area; Himalayas; Nepal","Smith-Hall, C.; Centre for Forest, Rolighedsvej 23, 1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; email: cso@life.ku.dk",,"Kluwer Academic Publishers",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

Motivated by our fieldwork, and using a spatial-temporal model, we focus on the paths of forest degradation and regeneration and villagers' utility before and after an access restriction is introduced. Our paper illustrates a number of key points for policy makers. First, the benefits of forest conservation tend to be greatest in the first few periods after an access restriction is introduced, after which the overall forest quality often declines. Second, villagers may displace their NTFP collection into more distant forests that may have been completely protected by distance alone before access to a closer forest was restricted. Third, permitting villagers to collect limited amounts of NTFPs for a fee, or alternatively fining villagers caught collecting illegally from the protected forest, and returning the fee or fine revenue to the villagers, can improve both forest quality and villagers' livelihoods. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Non-timber forest products; Participatory forest management; Spatial-temporal modelling; Tanzania","Access restriction; Before and after; Forest conservation; Forest degradation; Forest landscape; Forest management; Keypoints; Non-timber forest products; Policy makers; Spatial temporal model; Spatial temporals; Spatial-temporal modelling; Tanzania; Conservation; Timber; Reforestation","Robinson, E.J.Z.; Environment for Development Tanzania, Box 35045, Tanzania; email: ejzrobinson@hotmail.com",,,13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

We analyze the ecological economics of Brazil nut production in the Peruvian region of Madre de Dios where nut extraction occurs on hundreds of small-holder concessions operating under long-term agreements. This activity sustains locally important economies that suffer from small volumes and high seasonality. The size and the remoteness of the NTFP concession determine much of its profitability to concessionaires. Seasonality of the harvest generates short-term income peaks for the majority of collectors. The fragility of the Brazil nut economy in the region is compounded by volatile market prices and the overall development pressures in Amazonia, which usually involve deforestation. Although the current regulatory mechanisms in Peru encourage long-term Brazil nut production in concessions, the income level is seldom high enough to help concessionowners to rise from poverty. Auxiliary financial support based on compensations for the non-valued ecosystem services provided by the forest-covered Brazil nut concessions could change the picture. Funds for these could come from international instruments like those of carbon emission control or debt for nature swaps.

Afield experiment was conducted in 2007-2008 on a sulfur (S) and potassium (K) deficient clay loam soil under irrigation at the research farm of NWFP (Northwest Frontier Province) Agricultural University, Peshawar, Pakistan, with an objective to determine response of phenology and seed quality of Brassica oilseed rape versus mustard to S and K fertilizer application. Twenty treatments in a randomized complete block design were consisted of two oilseed genotypes [rape (B. napus canola) and mustard (B. juncea canola)], at three rates each of S (15, 30, and 45 kg S ha-1) and K (30, 60, and 90 kg K ha-1), plus control (no K and S applied). Days to flowering, pod formation, seed filling duration and maturity were enhanced with K and S fertilization compared to control plots. The species B. napus took more time to flowering, pod formation, seed filling duration and maturity compared to B. juncea. Both genotypes responded positively for seed quality (oil and protein content) to K and S fertilization, but the magnitude of response varied with level and combination of K and S fertilization. Delay in the phenological stages showed negative relationship with oil and protein content in seed of both genotypes. It is concluded that a combination of 60 kg K ha-1 + 30 kg S ha-1 would accelerate phenological development and improve seed quality of rape and mustard in the study area. © Crown Copyright.","Mustard; Phenology; Plant development; Rape; S and k fertilization; Seed quality","Brassica; Brassica juncea; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus","Malhi, S.

The potential role of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) in improving nutrition and health and reduction of poverty has been recognized in recent years. NTFPs continue to be an important source of household food security, nutrition, and health. Despite their significant contribution to food security, nutrition, and sustainable livelihoods, these tend to be overlooked by policy-makers. NTFPs have not been accorded adequate attention in development planning and in nutrition-improvement programmes in Ghana. Using exploratory and participatory research methods, this study identified the potentials of NTFPs in improving nutrition and food security in the country. Data collected from the survey were analyzed using the SPSS software (version 16.0). Pearson's correlation (p<0.05) showed that a significant association exists between NTFPs and household food security, nutrition, and income among the populations of Bibiani-Bekwai and Sefwi Wiawso districts in the western region of Ghana. NTFPs contributed significantly to nutrition and health of the poor in the two districts, especially during the lean seasons. The results of the survey also indicated that 90% of the sampled population used plant medicine to cure various ailments, including malaria, typhoid, fever, diarrhoea, arthritis, rheumatism, and snake-bite. However, a number of factors, including policy vacuum, increased overharvesting of NTFPs, destruction of natural habitats, bushfires, poor farming practices, population growth, and market demand, are hindering the use and development of NTFPs in Ghana. The study also provides relevant information that policy-makers and development actors require for improving nutrition and health in Ghana. © International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh.","Food Security; Forest; Ghana; Health; Micronutrients; Non-Timber Forest Products; Nutrition; Nutrition Disorders; Plant Medicine; Poverty Alleviation","trace element; article; catering service; crop; diet therapy; environmental protection; family size; Ghana; health care policy; health promotion; human; income; metabolism; nutritional disorder; nutritional status; population growth; poverty; questionnaire; statistics; tree; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Family Characteristics; Food Supply; Ghana; Health Promotion; Humans; Income; Micronutrients; Nutrition Disorders; Nutrition Policy; Nutritional Status; Population Growth; Poverty; Questionnaires; Trees","Ahenkan, A.; Human Ecology Department, Laarbeeklaan 103, B1090, Jette, Brussels, Belgium; email: aahenkan@vub.ac.be",,"International Center for Diarrhoeal Disease Research",16060997,,JHPNA,"21608423","English","J.

The present experiment was designed to ascertain the combined effect of organic and inorganic fertilizer management on rainfed wheat. Four levels of farm yard manure, FYM, (0, 10, 20, and 30 Mg FYM ha-1) and nitrogen (0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg N ha-1) were used. The experiment was conducted at the Agriculture Research Farm of NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan during crop season of 2003-04. The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with four replications. Plant height, productive tillers m-2, grains spike-1, grain yield, straw yield, and harvest index were significantly higher in plots which received 30 Mg FYM ha-1. In the case of nitrogen (N) no distinctive differences between the effect of 90 and 120 kg ha-1 was observed for most of the parameters. Nitrogen application at 90 kg ha-1 had significantly higher; plant height, grains spike-1, grain yield, straw yield, and harvest index as compared with the lower levels, i.e., 0,30, and 60 kg N ha-1 but were at par with 120 N kg ha-1. Significantly higher numbers of productive tillers m-2, grains spike-1, grain yield, straw yield and harvest index were recorded with application of 30 Mg FYM ha-1 + 90 kg N ha-1. The present study suggested that application of 30 Mg FYM ha-1 + 90 kg N ha-1 are promising levels for higher production of wheat under moisture stress conditions.

FDs finance their needs during lean season by taking advances from traders of NWFPs against forward mortgaging of the forthcoming harvest of NWFP. This is called NWFPs advance trade, which is exploitative in nature. FDs do not have access to formal financial systems to finance their needs. Pre-determined pricing on account of advance trading of NWFPs is done lower than the market price of such NWFPs and is known as distress sale of NWFPs. To check this exploitation of FDs by traders, microfinance during the lean season should be extended to the FDs, so that they can wait till an appropriate time to sell their NWFP harvest for better price. This will in turn enable the FDs to adopt value additions at their level to get better price. A study has been conducted in Madhya Pradesh on emerging microfinance practices. Findings of the study indicate that of the total financing undertaken, traders account for 52.8%, relative and friends 20.0%, selfhelp groups (SHGs) 15.4%, while banks and government schemes account for 11.8%. Use based categorization indicates that the main purposes of microfinance to FDs are as follow: health and subsistence account for 23.2 and 21.5%, respectively, followed by marriage purposes at 18.1% and education at 15.2%. Awareness about SHG movement amongst the FDs is 65.7%. There is a gap between awareness about SHG and membership held by the FDs. Interest rates vary from source to source. Traders charge about 3.83% per month (p.m.), SHGs 2.2% p.m. and relatives and friends 2%. Mean size of SHG is 12 members per group, though the maximum can be 20 members. The frequency of SHGs meeting is once in a month, average contribution per member per meeting various from Rs. 10 in some groups up to Rs. 50 in others. Governmental organizations (GOs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) should strengthen SHGs driven microfinance movement to bridge the gap and to increase dissemination of the microfinance movement. The institutional network, microfinance, marketing, technology, infrastructure development and other managerial interventions have to be augmented by all concerned GOs, banks and NGOs, keeping the local socio-economic aspects in mind, for effective and sustainable results. © 2010 WIT Press.","Forest dwellers; Microfinance; NWFPs; SHGs",,"Teki, S.; National Institute of Financial ManagementIndia",,,17437601,,,,"English","Int.

The ability to diversify livelihoods depends on asset portfolios and the economic shocks that rural households face. The main objective of this paper is to improve understanding of rural livelihood challenges in south-east Zimbabwe and how households in this area diversify livelihoods to cope with these challenges. A cluster analysis of 200 households surveyed in 2008 in the Chiredzi district identified five distinct livelihood strategies: (1) subsistence smallholders/unskilled workers; (2) subsistence smallholders/nontimber forestry products (NTFPs) harvesters; (3) crop production and NTFPs extraction integrators; (4) commercial smallholders with regular off-farm employment; and (5) specialised commercial livestock producers. Multinomial logit model results showed that the level of education of the household head, value of physical assets, cattle numbers and income, remittances, NTFP income and economic shocks were the main determinants of these livelihood choices. There is also some evidence that those households that were statistically significantly affected by HIV/AIDS shock practised distress-push diversification by harvesting NTFPs. These results suggest that policymakers need to advise rural households on how to improve their risk management capacities, and move from geographically untargeted investments in livelihood assets to a more integrated approach adapted to the asset bases of individual households. © Agricultural Economics Association of South Africa.","Asset endowments; Cluster analysis; Diversity; Livelihoods; Multinomial logit","Bos","Mutenje, M.

It bears the world's largest seed for which it is currently heavily exploited across its limited range, and it is clear that harvesting at current levels cannot be maintained indefinitely. Biologically informed harvesting protocols are therefore required to move towards sustainable management that secures the long-term viability of the population and the revenue that it currently generates. Demographic modelling using population matrix models is a useful tool in these efforts as it identifies both the life stages with the strongest influence on population dynamics as well as the consequences of current use intensities. Here we provide an initial population model based on data currently available to assess the status of the largest L. maldivica population in the Vallée de Mai World Heritage Site. We estimated transition probabilities and constructed matrices to estimate the populations' growth rate under current and alternative harvesting regimes, taking into account uncertainty regarding adult mortality and lifespan. Model projections of the population under current harvesting intensities forecast a marked decrease in the proportion of juveniles in the population and a gradually declining population over the next 200 years. Population growth rates were most sensitive to adult survival, reflecting the long generation time of this species and the remaining uncertainty in this respect. Based on this preliminary model we propose a precautionary sustainable harvesting limit for L. maldivica and discuss the challenges and opportunities of its management, including recommendations for future data collection. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Indian Ocean; Kernel; Management; Matrix population model; NTFP; Palm; Sustainable harvesting","Indian ocean; Kernel; Matrix population model; NTFP; Palm; Sustainable harvesting; Harvesting; Matrix algebra; Network protocols; Network security; Population dynamics; Uncertainty analysis; Population statistics; demography; ecological modeling; endemic species; evergreen tree; harvesting; juvenile; mortality; population decline; population growth; population modeling; population structure; seed; species conservation; survival; sustainable development; tourism; uncertainty analysis; Indian Ocean; Seychelles; Lodoicea maldivica","Rist, L.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, , 90187 Umeå, Sweden; email: lucy.rist@emg.umu.se",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Forestry graduates across the tropics remain poorly equipped on how to engage with local stakeholders, on the technical and economic aspects of multiple-use management, on participatory approaches to forest resource use, and on how to respond effectively to global forestry paradigms. By their very nature, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are located at the heart of a pluralistic view of tropical forest use and management and their inclusion in forestry curricula could promote interdisciplinary training. In this paper we provide some insights on the status and trends of NTFP education in Latin America through a synthesis of interviews with experts and the results of an electronic survey in order to outline some of the obstacles that need to be overcome in order to advance forestry curricula by using NTFPs. We argue that NTFPs are suitable to introduce topics that traditionally have not been taught to university level forestry students yet not necessarily through formal courses on NTFP management or textbooks on the topic. Instead, a modular approach may be a potentially effective way to promote interdisciplinary thinking and enhance adoption by university professors.","Forest management; forestry education; Latin America; multiuse forestry","curriculum; education; forest management; forestry practice; nontimber forest product; stakeholder; student; training; Latin America","Guariguata, M.

Despite the importance of non-wood forest products and services, forest management and planning methods and models in Europe have been traditionally wood production oriented, leading to a lack of tools that could help foresters to manage for optimizing these products. In the present work we'll discuss the main factors and challenges limiting the development of classical empirical models for NWFP, and we will review the existing models for the main NWFP in Europe: cork, pine nuts, berries, mushrooms and resins.","Berry; Cork; Empirical models; Mushroom; Pine nut; Resin","Basidiomycota","Calama, R.; Departamento de Selvicultura y Gestión Forestal CIFOR-INIA, Ctra.

However, the extraction of NTFPs such as rattan cane may conflict with forest conservation efforts. A better understanding of harvesting practices can help assess the extent of this conflict and guide forest management decisions. This study assesses the accessibility factors that influence rattan cane harvesting levels in Lambusango Forest, Buton Island, Indonesia, and whether the harvesting of rattan cane is affected by the designation of conservation areas. To this end, the analysis adopts participatory mapping, Geographic Information Systems and a questionnaire survey and employs multiple regressions and analysis of covariance. The results show that accessibility, particularly slope and distance, can play a role in the quantity of rattan canes harvested. The presence of conservation forest does not significantly affect rattan cane harvesting levels. This could be due to limited awareness of the harvesters going to the vicinity of the designated conservation areas and mixed sentiments towards conservation efforts due to the long tradition of forest dwelling and harvesting activities. The study concludes that the successful establishment and management of conservation areas require consideration of the specificity of the local context such as the abundance of forest resources, accessibility and historical forest-people interactions, in addition to biological factors. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Accessibility; Buton Island; Conservation forest; NTFP; Rattan cane harvesting","accessibility; conservation management; forest management; forest product; GIS; harvesting; mapping; nature-society relations; questionnaire survey; Buton; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Southeast Sulawesi; Sulawesi; Sunda Isles; Calamus rotang","Widayati, A.; World Agroforestry Centre, Jl.

The study was started in summer 2006 and continued for four consecutive crop seasons till winter 2007, in District Swabi, NWFP, Pakistan. Soil fertility status of the experimental site was determined before the start of the experiment. The experiment was laid out in a factorial split plot design using two factors viz cropping patterns and fertilizer treatments. The cropping patterns included maize-wheat-maize rotation, maize-lentil-maize rotation and maize-wheat+lentil intercrop-maize rotation and these were kept in main plots whereas the fertilizer treatments included control, 50% NP, 100% NPK and 20 t ha-1 farmyard manure integrated with 50% N and 100% PK as mineral fertilizers which were placed in sub plots. Fertilizers were applied for four seasons continuously. At the end of winter 2007, soil samples from two depths (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm) were collected from each plot and analyzed for microbial biomass carbon (MBC) at day 3, day 6 and day 10 incubation periods, total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and mineralizable nitrogen (MN). Results showed significant improvement in organic fertility of soil with fertilizer addition and cropping patterns. Combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers (20 t ha-1 farmyard manure integrated with 50% N and 100% PK) showed 55, 25, 18 and 61% increase in total N, MBN, MN, and MBC after 10 days incubation period over the control, respectively, in the surface soil whilst 100% NPK showed 44, 15, 6 and 45% improvement over the control treatment for the same parameters in surface soil. Data further showed 43, 23, 19 and 60% increase in the corresponding microbial parameters in combined organic and inorganic fertilizer treatment over the control treatment in sub soil whilst 100% NPK showed 39, 20, 10 and 54% increase in TN, MBN, MN and MBC over the control in sub soil. The cropping patterns having cereal-legume rotation also improved organic soil fertility and showed 27 and 13% more total N and MBC after 10 days incubation period over the cereal-cereal rotation respectively and the improvement in MBN and MN in cereal-legume rotation over cereal-cereal rotation was non significant in surface soil. In the sub-surface soil cereal-legume rotation improved TN, MBN, MN and MBC by 9, 6, 8 and 28% over the cereal-cereal rotation. It was concluded that there is sufficient potential to improve soil organic fertility in Pirsabak soil series, the restoration of which on sustained basis would require at least 50% N from the organic sources. Moreover legumes must be included in the traditional cereal-cereal cropping pattern to further improve the N input and organic fertility of these soils. © 2010, Soil Science Society of Pakistan.","Cropping patterns; Eroded soil; Farmyard manure; Legumes; Microbial biomass carbon; Microbial biomass nitrogen","Lens culinaris; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","Ahmad, W.; Department of Soil and Environmental Sciences, , Peshawar, Pakistan; email: wiqar280@yahoo.co.uk",,,20749546,,,,"English","Soil Environ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951731275

By 1990, there were 3,274,000 officially registered refugees living in Pakistan (another 500,000 to one million were unaccounted for).1 Seventy percent of refugees resided in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).2 Urban refugees systematically fled to cities, settling into what became semi-suburban shantytowns, whereas the rural population joined family or village members in camps, attempting to re-create familiar social units. Since March 2002, more than 4.7 million refugees have returned to Afghanistan. It was estimated that in 2008 approximately 2 million refugees were still living in Pakistan. Because the situation in Afghanistan continues to be unstable, camp life often represents a safe and desirable alternative. Even when major camps close, many of the inhabitants simply move on to other refugee settlements within the country, refusing the pitiful $100 handout offered by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) for repatriation. Why return to a homeland where the prospect of peace remains as distant as it has for the past thirty years? An entire generation of Afghan refugees has grown up in the camps. Sustained only by yearnings for an imagined homeland, their identity and expectations are products of harsh camp life. The particular configuration that has linked the destinies of the border populations of Pakistan and Afghanistan has resulted in long-term consequences, especially for Afghan women. Members of the Taliban have been much demonized by the West, depicted as instigators of reactionary politics against women. This delayed reaction from the West, precipitated by the events in the United States of September 11, 2001, came six long years after the Taliban swept into power. Many suggest that the Western response to the Taliban has been nothing more than a propaganda tool to justify allied intervention in Afghanistan. In this chapter, I demonstrate how the previous generation of Westernsupported mujahedin, initially fighting America's proxy war against the Soviet Union, were the precursors paving the way for Taliban excesses. I further argue that since the fall of the pro-Soviet government in Afghanistan, women especially have suffered from a combination of hard-line Islamist radicalization and the exacerbation of traditional patriarchal practices promoted in Pakistani refugee camps over the past twenty-eight years. The ideological mix emanating from the camps, unique in the Muslim world, has successfully eliminated Afghan alternative secular nationalist discourses. This includes the subversion of progressive Islamic trends, all of which were present in the late 1970s, before the 1978 pro-Communist coup. As Edward Said has argued, this represented a clash within a single civilization, rather than a clash between East and West, as suggested by Samuel Huntington.3 These progressive alternatives were swept away by massive Western support of the mujahedin in the protracted conflagration of the Cold War, the catastrophic results of which form the basis of Afghanistan's problems today. The Afghan government's decision to grant blanket amnesty and legal protection for war crimes in the name of the National Stability and Reconciliation Bill has made it possible for onetime warlords to occupy positions of unchallenged and uncontrollable power.4 What has unified these warlords since the war against the Soviets is a threefold dynamic: their active engagement in the modern global capitalist economy (e.g., through drug trafficking), their purported religious orthodoxy, and their particularly reactionary policies towards women. That which remains is a caricature of the East/West dialectic. A loose reactionary ideology inherited at once from the mujahedin and the Taliban is presented as the sole alternative to dominant Western democratic-liberal economic discourse embedded in reconstruction politics in Kabul. Much of the clout behind this reactionary force draws on the perception of Western options as a failure to address Afghan cultural values. The gap between women's theoretical constitutional rights and their daily reality - especially in Afghanistan's rural areas - has been one of the main consequences of this situation. Despite visible improvements in some urban areas, the standard of Afghan women's lives (that is to say, 85 percent of the population) may well be sinking. The most relevant indicator is the rate of maternal mortality, still the highest in the world, especially in the Badakhshan region. Neither U.S.-directed policies with huge accompanying aid packages nor the Afghan religious conservatives and Taliban supporters seem to have made a dent in the dismal condition of Afghan women's health. As far as health choices are concerned (which includes the right to be examined by a doctor), women remain entirely at the mercy of fathers and husbands. Extremist violence against women goes unpunished as patriarchal privilege continues to dominate any kind of state or religious legislation. This chapter explores four key areas of inquiry. First, I examine those wartime changes in gendered cultural norms that traditional rural Afghan populations have used to define themselves during exile and after. These cultural references are duplicated on both sides of the Durand line, a porous and artificial frontier inhabited by a population numbering 22 million.5 This population is referred to as Pathan on the Pakistani side and Pashtun across the Afghan border. Second, I examine how radical Islam emerged and triumphed in refugee camps, having been previously a marginal force in Afghanistan, limited to a sector of Kabul university students. The camps provided ideal conditions for experimenting with social forms of women's repression, creating a social model handily imported back into Afghanistan after the demise of the pro-Communist government. Third, I address the changes (and resistance to change) affecting female Afghan refugees living in camps along the NWFP from the late 1970s to 2006. These are the years of major foreign military interventions, first by the Soviet Union (1979) and then by the U.S.- led coalition (2001). Finally, I explore the consequences such changes have had on the lives of women living in Pakistan's refugee camps and inside the NWFP, as well as in Afghanistan. This chapter is based on fieldwork conducted in Pakistan and Afghanistan between December 2001 and June 2006, including Afghan enclaves within Pakistani cities, namely Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar. Brief comments were added after a trip to Afghanistan in May 2008. Fieldwork also took place in several Afghan camps situated along the NWFP in Pakistan, including Jalozai, Kobobian, Nazir Bagh, Katcha Gari, Shamshatoo, and Akkora Hattak and the smaller camps, Sharwali and Khewa.

Planting time and density are the major factors affecting phenological development, assimilate partitioning and yield of faba bean. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of planting date and plant density on phenological development, assimilate partitioning and yield of faba bean. Faba bean was planted on eight dates from September 20 to December 27, 1999 with 14 days interval maintaining 4 density (150,000, 300,000, 450,000, 600,000 plants ha-1) at New Developmental Farm, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar. Planting dates and population density significantly affected days to flowering, days to maturity, grains pod-1, plant height and grain yield ha-1. However, days to emergence and maturity were only affected by planting date. Crop planted on September 20 took minimum days to emergence (5 days) and maximum days to flowering (57.6), maturity (204), produced more grains pod-1 (3.4) and taller plants (176.9 cm). Crop planted on October 4, 1999 produced maximum grain yield (4153 kg ha-1). Plant density of 450,000 plants ha-1 took maximum days to flowering (54.2), more grain pod-1 (3.2) and produced maximum grain yield (2498 kg ha-1), while population density of 600,000 plants ha-1 produced tallest plants (146.3 cm). It can be concluded that faba bean can be planted up to October 4 at 450,000 plants ha-1 to obtain maximum yield.",,"Vicia faba","Khalil, S.

There is increasing concern about the population status of NTFP-providing trees and therefore a need for their sustainable use. Thus, this study examines the impact of land-use type on the multipurpose baobab tree (Adansonia digitata L.) in Burkina Faso, combined with rates and patterns of bark- and leaf-harvesting, and their impact on fruit production. We compared stands in a protected area (W National Park of Burkina Faso) with those of surrounding communal area (fallows, croplands and villages) to obtain an indication on the status of the baobab population, to assess its harvesting tolerance and to estimate to what extent their actual use is sustainable. Our results reveal that land-use type has an impact on the population structure of the baobab. The size class distribution curve of park stands was inverse J-shape which indicates good rejuvenation, while the curve of fallows, croplands and villages stands was bell-shaped, indicating a lack of recruitment. However, a high number of seedlings were recorded in villages. Nearly all baobabs were pruned and debarked in villages, croplands and fallows while half of the individuals were harvested in the park. Most of the trees were pruned and debarked moderately. Debarking and pruning were slightly size specific. Pruning in interaction with tree-size had a significant impact on fruit production. In contrast, debarking had no effect on fruit production. We conclude that despite the land-use impact and the intense harvesting, baobabs are still well preserved in the communal area due to their longevity, extremely low adult mortality rates and traditional management practices. However, land-use intensifications may lead to increasing pressure on baobab populations in the future. Therefore, adapted management strategies are needed to guarantee the persistence of this important species and to avoid a shortage of baobab products. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Livelihood security; Multipurpose tree; Non-timber forest product; Sustainable use; W National Park","Livelihood security; Multipurpose trees; National parks; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable use; Forestry; Fruits; Harvesting; Land use; Timber; Parks; adaptive management; bark; dicotyledon; forest management; fruit production; harvesting; herb; land use change; longevity; nontimber forest product; population structure; pruning; recruitment (population dynamics); savanna; seedling; semiarid region; sustainable forestry; village; West Africa; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata","Schumann, K.; J.W.Goethe University, Siesmayerstraße 70, 60323 Frankfurt am Main, Germany; email: Schumann@bio.uni-frankfurt.de",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Its overexploitation from medicinal tree species threatens an essential source of medication for rural populations. Despite the relevance of bark, not much information is available on the ecological impact of bark harvesting. In Benin, West Africa, we investigated how various harvesting techniques affect the bark re-growth of 12 tree species and the survival of debarked trees. Trees were debarked following a combination of three factors: (i) season of bark harvesting (dry or rainy season), (ii) size class of the tree (three stem diameter classes) and (iii) intensity of debarking (seven different percentages of trunk circumference debarked). Measurements of edge growth and survival were taken every 6. months during 2. years. Ring-barking (100% of trunk circumference debarked) did not allow the sustainable exploitation of any species, while all trees with 75% of debarked circumference remained alive and produced edge growth. Whatever the bark harvesting technique, 5 out of the 12 species had a bark recovery rate below 1. cm/year, rendering the wound closure very unlikely. On the other hand, five species showed good to very good bark recovery rates (>7. cm/year) and for these species the combination of debarking factors (season, dbh and intensity) allowing the highest edge growth was determined. This experimental bark stripping revealed the complexities involved in decision-making for sustainable tree management. Studying the patterns of bark recovery rates provides a relevant tool to assess for each species the delay for achieving closure of a specific wound area. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bark stripping; Decision tool; Non-timber forest product; Ring-barking; West Africa","bark; climate effect; decision making; diameter; ecological impact; experimental study; exploitation; harvesting; medicinal plant; nontimber forest product; regrowth; rural population; seasonality; stem; survival; sustainability; wounding; Benin [West Africa]","Delvaux, C.; Laboratory of Tropical and Subtropical Agronomy and Ethnobotany, Coupure links, 653, 9000 Ghent, Belgium; email: claire.delvaux@ugent.be",,,00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

However, simply excluding them from the area management has always inevitably resulted in conflicts. We conducted a case study of the Protected Area of Jinyun Mountain (PJM) in China to evaluate social context variables, environmental attitudes, and perceptions regarding protected area-community conflicts. Data were collected through questionnaire surveys administered to four stakeholder groups (i.e. local farmers, government staff, business persons, and tourists). A total of 112 questionnaires were completed in December 2008, after the Sichuan Earthquake. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, social context (gender, race, age, income, and education level), protected area-community conflicts, and environmental attitudes. The New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scores, which were employed to evaluate environmental attitudes, differed significantly among the stakeholder groups (P< 0.01). Specifically, government staff reported the highest and business persons did the lowest. Among the five items evaluated, anti-exemptionalism received the lowest score, while nature's balance did the highest. Evaluation of the protected area-community relationship indicated that harmony and conflict both exist in the PJM, but have different forms among different stakeholders, and seem to be opposite between government staff and local farmers. Among the indexes, tourism primarily contributed to the harmonious aspect, while collection of NTFPs did to the conflicting one. Conflict scores were positively related to age and negatively related to education level. Respondents with higher NEP scores were more partial to the park management. Besides, the respondents with higher annual incomes tended to support the policy of harmonizing the relationship and lessening the harm of local communities to the area. To promote proenvironmental attitudes and alleviate the protected area-community conflicts, we recommend improving environmental education, establishing community co-management, and launching substitute sources of cash for traditional cultivation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Conflict; Environmental attitudes; Local community; New ecological paradigm; Perception; Protected area management","conflict management; farmers attitude; government; income distribution; local government; natural resource; park management; perception; protected area; questionnaire survey; Sichuan earthquake 2008; stakeholder; wildlife management; academic achievement; age; agricultural management; agricultural worker; article; attitude; China; community; conflict; earthquake; environmental management; environmental protection; government; resource management; social environment; tourism; Agriculture; Attitude; China; Commerce; Conflict (Psychology); Conservation of Natural Resources; Consumer Participation; Data Collection; Government; Humans; Public Opinion; Questionnaires; Residence Characteristics; Travel; China; Chongqing; Jinyun Mountain","Ouyang, Z.No. 18 Shuangqing Road, Haidian District, Beijing City, China; email: zyouyang@rcees.ac.cn",,,03014797,,JEVMA,"20619528","English","J.

Primary data was collected from 315 HHs which consist 2455 HH members from district Peshawar. Schooling, exposure to mass media, HH income and occurrence of diarrhoeal diseases were used to measure the HHs' response towards the health risks associated with contaminated water. Moreover, to find out public acceptability to government and private sector as service providers, HH's were asked two separate questions regarding their maximum willingness to pay for an improved water system by either one. Out of the sample HHs, 78.4 percent were willing to accept improved water system provided by government while relatively less HHs (55.6 percent) were WTP in the case of private company as the service provider.

Female migrants dominate in internal migration (age 10 years and above). In case of female migration, marriage plays a vital role. Further the direction of migration reveals that over time in internal migration the share of rural to urban migration has increased while urban to urban migration declined, however, the share of urban to urban migration remains highest in internal migration. Females are dominating in recent rural to urban move compared to long term and total rural to urban migration. Gender composition of intra-provincial move of rural to urban migration reveals that in all provinces female migrants are dominated. Further, the trend of intra and inter provincial move indicates that in all provinces long distance movement of females has increased. Not only the share of female migrant in rural to urban migration increased but there seems to be an increasing trend in family migration to cities. This seems to be due to the changes in agrarian structure and rural economy particularly increased in landless households, declined in share cropping and rise in small land holding. In addition to this, the trend in intra and inter-provincial move reveals that except in province of NWFP in all three provinces migration to long distance has an upward trend.

Cost-benefit analyses including Net Present Value (NPV) and Benefit-Cost Ratio (BCR) show that all the NTFP species are more profitable than field crops. This profitability relationship holds true even under a sensitivity analysis assuming a 20% reduction in yield and/or fall in prices. However, despite the profitability, farmers do not readily integrate these species into their farmlands on a large scale. A regression analysis of constraining factors explored in a household survey revealed that domestication of NTFP species is significantly influenced by factors such as knowledge and skill required for domestication, frequency of visits to a forest, length of fallow period, size of upland terraces, cattle and goat herd size, accessibility of a forest, permit system, trading system, and market uncertainty. Overall, the unfavorable institutional environment has been the major factor constraining the integration of NTFP species into farmland. Policy recommendations include transferring management to local people such as changing the open-access status of national forests; providing NTFP collection permits to local residents; amending inappropriate policies; promoting group marketing; and taking an adaptive, collaborative approach to community forestry. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Arundinaria intermedia; Asparagus racemosus; Cinnamomum tamala; Cost-benefit analysis; Eastern nepal; Institutional constraints; Ntfp domestication; Ntfp policy; Swertia chirayita; Texus baccata","Asparagus racemosus; Cinnamomum tamala; Eastern nepal; Institutional constraints; Intermedia; Ntfp domestication; Ntfp policy; Swertia chirayita; Texus baccata; Bamboo; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Crops; Forestry; Integration; Landforms; Profitability; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Societies and institutions; Soil conservation; Surveys; Timber; Uncertainty analysis; Cost benefit analysis; community forestry; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; cultivation; domestication; forestry policy; nontimber forest product; profitability; Nepal; Arundinaria; Asparagus; Asparagus racemosus; Bos; Capra hircus; Cinnamomum; Cinnamomum tamala; Swertia","Pandit, B.

The accelerated loss of forest vegetation is often perceived to result from increased unsustainable exploitation by poor rural populations for their livelihood needs. To explore this critique, we examined smallholder farmers' (SHFs) views on the management and utilization of trees for livelihood improvement and environmental protection. The study involved a cross-sectional survey conducted with SHFs from two villages in Kosti province through questionnaire-based interviews, focus group discussions, and Participatory Learning and Action methodology. Descriptive statistics suggest that forest product exploitation by SHFs has the potential to be sustainable, and is important for both subsistence and income generation. Management strategies adopted by the SHFs to ensure improved yields include (a) the use of drought-tolerant crop varieties; and (b) tree management practices such as assisted natural regeneration, pollarding, and selective harvesting. Such practices are viewed as valuable land-use technologies by SHFs in Sudan to reduce the loss of forest and woodlands that is speeding up environmental degradation. This study concludes that SHFs have a wide range of experience and practical knowledge relevant to ensure and achieve a sustainable management of natural resources and environmental protection alongside livelihood improvement. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agroforestry; Drylands; Forest utilization; Ntfp; Perception; Smallholder farmers; Sudan; Tree management","Agroforestry; Dry land; Forest utilization; Ntfp; Perception; Smallholder farmers; Sudan; Tree management; Agriculture; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Land use; Management; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Reforestation; agroforestry; deforestation; environmental protection; forest management; land use; perception; smallholder; sustainability; Biological Populations; Deforestation; Forest Management; Land Use; Management; Reforestation; Statistics; Kosti; Sudan; White Nile","Kalame, F.

However, no research studies have been conducted to validate these tests in term of predicting future performance of the students. The main purpose of this study is to examine the Predictability of Engineering students' performance at the University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar from admission test conducted by Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency (ETEA), NWFP. Method: A cohort of 203 engineering students, who were admitted for the four-year programme in different disciplines at University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Peshawar, NWFP in the 2000-2001 academic session, were considered. The association between the predictors (FSc, Entry test scores and overall merit) and the criterion (academic achievements/scores of engineering students from first to final year) were analyzed using appropriate statistical procedures on SPSS-10. Result: The data show significant relationship between FSc marks and students scores up to third year at the 0.05 level while relationship between entry test marks and overall merit with students scores up to third year show significant relationship both at the 0.05 and 0.01 level for male and overall students. But for the female students and some engineering disciplines, the result is even more surprising as it shows that there is a negative relationship between the predictor's scores and the academic achievement. This is because analyses were based on comparatively smaller sample sizes of students (female were 7% of the total students only The relationship between Predictors (FSc, Entry test and Overall merit) and final year scores was found negative for male and overall students but it was found significant for female students. Conclusions and suggestions: Overall, our findings indicate that there is significant relationship between the Predictors (FSc, ETEA entry test scores and overall merit) and the academic achievement of engineering students. However, development of additional predictors, such as interview or test of non-cognitive domains of the students may improve the accuracy of admission decisions. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Laboratory and field tests were conducted during 2003 and 2004 in NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan, to investigate the suitability of various laboratory vigor tests, to rank quality of commercial seed lots, and to predict seedling field emergence (FE) of 32 samples of 4 wheat varieties. Seeds of four wheat cultivars Takbeer 2000, Haider 2000, Bakhtawar-92 and Fakhri Sarhad were produced in 8 different location of NWFP, Pakistan during 2003 and 2004. Mature seeds were harvested, threshed and cleaned before determining standard germination and other vigor tests. Results showed that among all tests, germination index (GI), Accelerated aging (AA) and Electrical conductivity (EC) provided the best estimate of seed vigor for the four wheat cultivars, both for ranking seed lots quality and predicting field emergence. The GI, AA and EC tests better indicated seed lot quality and predicted FE than SG of the four cultivars over the 2-years followed by Radical length (RL). The electrical conductivity (EC) result was not only poorly related to FE, but also poorly related to the standard germination (SG) of a wide range of seed lots of the four varieties that varied in viability. Initial count of standard germination (SGi) generally performed more poorly than the other vigor tests. From this study and previous work on wheat crop, we conclude that GI, AA and EC test for wheat crop have the potential to be developed as improved vigor tests for ranking seed lot quality and predicting seeding performance under temperate regions of the world.",,"Triticum aestivum","Khan, A.

Among all the parameters studied, P source had significant effects on CGR (crop growth rate), LAI (leaf area index), PER (plant elongation rate), LER (leaf expansion rate), DM (dry matter) and grain yield, but had no significant effects on AGR (absolute growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), RGR (relative growth rate) and LAR (leaf area ratio). Plots applied with DAP or SSP had maximum AGR, CGR, RGR, LAI, LER, DM and grain yields as compared to plots applied with NP and with zero-P control plots. Increase in planting density had negative effects on AGR, NAR, RGR and grain yield plant-1 (D1 &gt; D2 &gt; D3 &gt; D4) and had positive effects on LAI, LAR, LER and PER (D1 &lt; D2 &lt;D3 &lt; D4). Growing maize at D3 (8 plants m-2) had highest CGR, DM and grain yields m-2 (D3 &gt; D4 &gt; D2 &gt; D1). The findings suggest that growing maize at D3 applied with SSP or DAP could be more beneficial in the wheatmaize cropping system in the study area.",,"Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","Rahman, H.; Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, , Peshawar, Pakistan; email: draman_agronomist@yahoo.com",,,05563321,,,,"English","Pak.

The Shaxi Valley in Yunnan Province, P. R. China, is inhabited by Tibeto-Burman ethnic groups. We found a clear dichotomy between household strategies in the valley bottom and the mountain areas, with significantly lower household income in the mountains. The majority Bai people live predominantly in the fertile valley floor and cultivate rice, keep livestock, and commonly pursue off-farm work. Other ethnic groups live in more remote mountainous areas of the Shaxi Valley, where the collection of non-wood forest products, especially wild mushrooms, plays an important role in securing livelihoods. However, only households in the valley's central villages engage in the profitable non-wood forest product trade. Mushroom populations appear to be less vulnerable to commercial harvest than the rapidly declining wild medicinal plant populations. Due to this decline, local farmers have gained interest in cultivating medicinal plants, but only if risks are low and if financial and technical support is provided. Encouraging the cultivation of medicinal plants appears to be an appropriate means of sustainable community development. © 2010 The New York Botanical Garden.","Bai; ethnobotany; non-timber forest products (NTFP); Shaxi; Southwest China; Yunnan","Basidiomycota","Weckerle, C.

The data were recorded for plant height (cm), leaf lamina width (cm), leaf lamina length (cm), number of leaves plant-1 and polymorphism at DNA level. Different biotypes appeared to differ in their competitive ability, as due to variation in agronomic parameters. Range of amplified fragments was from &lt; 250 to &gt; 1000 bp in size. The degree of genetic polymorphism ranged from 0 to 100%, indicating that the studied germplasm of wild oat is genetically very diverse and possesses a higher degree of polymorphism. Consequently their competitive ability will also be varying. Thus, in the areas of the more competitive wild oats biotypes more attention will be needed on the control of wild oats as compared to the less competitive genotypes.

Wilczek) under semi arid rainfed conditions at the Livestock Research Station, Surezai, Peshawar in North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. The experiment comprised of two tillage i) conventional tillage (T1) and ii) no-tillage (T0) and two residues i) wheat crop residues retained (+) and ii) wheat crop residues removed (-) treatments. Basal doses of N @ 20: P @ 60 kg ha-1 were applied to mungbean at sowing time in the form of urea and single super phosphate respectively. Labelled urea having 5% 15N atom excess was applied @ 20 kg N ha-1 as aqueous solution in micro plots (1m2) in each treatment plot to assess BNF by mungbean. Similarly, maize and sorghum were grown as reference crops and were fertilized with 15N labelled urea as aqueous solution having 1% 15N atom excess @ 90 kg N ha-1. The results obtained showed that mungbean yield (grain/straw) and WUE were improved in no-tillage treatment as compared to tillage treatment. Maximum mungbean grain yield (1224 kg ha-1) and WUE (6.61kg ha-1 mm-1) were obtained in no-tillage (+ residues) treatment. The N concentration in mungbean straw and grain was not significantly influenced by tillage or crop residue treatments. The amount of fertilizer-N taken up by straw and grain of mungbean was higher under no-tillage with residues-retained treatment but the differences were not significant. The major proportion of N (60.03 to 76.51%) was derived by mungbean crop from atmospheric N2 fixation, the remaining (19.6 to 35.91%) was taken up from the soil and a small proportion (3.89 to 5.89%) was derived from the applied fertilizer in different treatments. The maximum amount of N fixed by mung bean (82.59 kg ha-1) was derived in no-tillage with wheat residue-retained treatment. By using sorghum as reference crop, the biological nitrogen fixed by mungbean ranged from 37.00 to 82.59 kg ha-1 whereas with maize as a reference crop, it ranged from 34.74 to 70.78 kg ha-1 under different treatments. In comparison, non-fixing (reference) crops of sorghum and maize derived upto 16.6 and 15.5% of their nitrogen from the labelled fertilizer, respectively. These results suggested that crop productivity, BNF and WUE in the rainfed environment can be improved with minimum tillage and crop residues retention.",,"Triticum aestivum; Vigna radiata; Vigna radiata var. radiata; Zea mays","Mohammad, W.; Nuclear Institute for Food and Agriculture (NIFA), P.O.

They contribute substantially to rural livelihoods, generate revenue for companies and governments, and have a range of impacts on biodiversity conservation. However, there is little information available for those seeking to develop effective policy frameworks and regulation. This book addresses that shortage with information and recommendations on the drafting, content and implementation of NTFP policies, and the broader issues of governance associated with these products. It reviews the diverse elements that combine to create laws and policies that promote sustainable and equitable management, trade and use of species. Drawing on a wealth of unique case studies from around the world, this volume examines experiences with NTFP regulation, including its sometimes unintended consequences. It looks at economic factors, the interface between traditional and western knowledge and legal systems, and relationships between NTFP regulation, land tenure and resource rights, as well as power and equity imbalances.

It was introduced here in early 1932 by Sardar Faqir Singh from Dera Dune, India, and remained an exotic plant until 1960s when commercial production started from few orchards located near Begum Kot, Lahore of Punjab province. Owing to its good fruit quality and profitability in early sixties, large scale plantations expanded to North West Frontier Province (NWFP) (Harri Pur, Hazara and Khan Pur) and later to Sindh (Tando Allah Yar, Nawab Shah, Moro, Mir Pur Khas) province. At present it is grown on an area of around 3000 acres with annual production of about 9250 MT. The main cultivars are Bedana, Calcutti, Dera Dune/Gola, Bombay, Chinese, Lychee Siah and Madrasi. Gola and Calcutti are two widely grown commercial cultivars, the former is consistent bearer while later shows alternate bearing habit. Nursery plants are propagated asexually through pot layering with 80% success rate. System of irrigation is surface flooding. Over 95% orchards are marketed through pre-harvest contractors. Fruits are mostly commercialized using mulberry baskets with 20-80 kg net weight. Harvesting season is well distributed and starts from May (Sindh) through June (Punjab) to July (NWFP province). Over 90% fruit is domestically consumed as fresh with little processing and negligible exports. Due to hot dry weather fruit skin cracking is the biggest issue in Southern Punjab. Main constraints for lychee production are: lack of quality nursery plants, long juvenile period (7-8 years), insufficient R&D based information for nutritional requirements, shortage of irrigation water and high postharvest losses. Potential of lychee remains under exploit so far, better production infra-structure and postharvest facilities are needed to boost industry for quality production and exports. This paper gives comprehensive information on Pakistan lychee industry, along with the potential and future prospects.","Cultivars; Cultivation history; Harvesting season; Lychee; Pakistan; Prospects","Litchi chinensis; Morus (angiosperm)","Rajwana, I.

The announcement of support prices had certainly strong bearing on rice production in NWFP. In view of production response of rice, the short run and long run support price elasticities as well as short and long run fertilizer offtake elasticities were found sizeable with low divergence. 2nd aspect of findings suggest that fertilizer offtake has shown remarkable influence over wheat acreage (P&lt;0.10).

One hundred and sixty-four reports of lynx occurrence and 214 incidents of livestock depredation were recorded from 2001-2008 in an area of 14,850km2 of the district. Highest reports were from the Mastuj and lowest from the Torkhow tehsil. Livestock especially sheep lambs and goat kids were the major victims of lynx attack followed by poultry. This livestock loss means an economic hardship for the poor communities, thus, is a major source of human-cat conflicts. The prime threats to the existence of carnivores were retaliatory killing, loss of natural prey-base, loss of habitat, overpopulation, and lack of awareness and support.","Chitral; Depredation; Himalayan lynx; Population; Status","Capra hircus; Lynx; Lynx lynx; Ovis aries","Nawaz, M.

The household level benefits have been estimated in terms of employment generation, income from timber and non-timber forest products (NTFP), and fuel wood collection from community managed forests. Further, we have examined the impact of JFM via FPCs on environmental stress migration (ESM) by adopting a Logit Regression Model at household level. It has been found that the employment opportunities have increased significantly since the establishment of FPCs. The findings of the study establish that the improvement in forest cover under JFM has positive impact on the reduction of stress migration in the study area. The ESM, which was severe in these villages before the implementation of JFM, has come down significantly over the years.

In tropical developing countries, the management of PAs is a great challenge as many contain resources on which local communities rely. Collection and trading of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is a well-established forest-based livelihood strategy, which has been promoted as a potential means for enhanced conservation and improved rural livelihoods in recent years, even though the sustainability or ecological implications have rarely been tested. We conducted an exploratory survey to understand the role and stakeholder views on conservation prospects and perceived ecological feasibility of NTFPs and harvesting schemes in a northeastern PA of Bangladesh, namely the Satchari National Park. Households (n = 101) were interviewed from three different forest dependency categories, adopting a stratified random sampling approach and using a semi-structured questionnaire. The study identified 13 locally important NTFPs, with five being critically important to supporting local livelihoods. Our study suggests that collection, processing and trading in NTFPs constitutes the primary occupation for about 18% of local inhabitants and account for an estimated 19% of their cash annual income. The household consensus on issues relating to NTFPs and their prospective role in conservation was surprisingly high, with 48% of respondents believing that promotion of NTFPs in the PA could have positive conservation value. The majority (71%) of households also had some understanding of the ecological implications of NTFP harvesting, sustainability (53%) and possible management and monitoring regimes (100%). With little known about their real application in the field, our study suggests further investigations are required to understand the ecological compatibility of traditional NTFP harvesting patterns and management. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","Biodiversity loss; Ecological consensus; Forest-based livelihood; Harvesting pattern; Rural poverty; Sustainability","biodiversity; conservation management; developing world; estimation method; feasibility study; forest management; harvesting; integrated approach; management practice; nontimber forest product; protected area; questionnaire survey; rural area; stakeholder; sustainability","Mukul, S.A.; Department of Forestry and Environmental Science, , Sylhet, 3114, Bangladesh; email: sharif_a_mukul@yahoo.com",,,13504509,,IJSDB,,"English","Int.

The findings suggest that the complex nexus of education, religion, and national identity tends to construct 'essentialist' collective identities-a single identity as a naturalized defining feature of the collective self. To promote national unity across the diverse ethnic groups comprising Pakistan, the national curriculum uses religion (Islam) as the key boundary between the Muslim Pakistani 'self' and the antagonist non-Muslim 'other'.

Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted in two districts of N.W.F.P. namely Peshawar and Abbotabad from August 2007 up till January 2008. A total of 153 participants were interviewed from high risk group by convenient sampling. The high risk group included commercial sex workers and injection drug users. Information was also gathered from in-charges of VCT centers. The data were collected in two phases, in the first phase data were collected in Peshawar while in the second phase data were collected in Abbotabad. Out of 153 respondents 102 (67%) were interviewed in Peshawar while 51 (33%) respondents were interviewed in Abbotabad. Results: A total of 153 respondents were interviewed, that included commercial sex workers (123) and injection drug users (30). Mostly the participants were young with a mean age of 24 ± 8.8 years. As far as transmission of HIV was concerned 57% reported that HIV was transmitted through sexual contact, 09% said it was transmitted by contaminated instruments and syringes and around 11% reported its transmission by eating with persons having HIV/AIDS while 04% said it was transmitted by hugging/kissing. The level of knowledge about VCT was very low and about 27% of the participants had heard about VCT center. Only a small number i.e.16 out of 153 partipants visited VCT centres. Conclusions: The study concluded that there is lackof awareness among high risk group regarding VCT and those who have heard about VCT (27%) only a few had visited the VCT center.

Considerable food production per unit area and per unit of water is inevitable to meet present-day needs. The optimal use and effective management of water resources may lead to a significant increase in food production. The present study evaluates two different operational strategies for optimal and economical use of water in a downstream control irrigation system of the Upper Swat Canal in the North West Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. Firstly, the computerized weekly rotational scheduling was determined by using the Crop Based Irrigation Operation (CBIO) software developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). Secondly, the application of CBIO coupled with closing the canals at night was simulated using the Canal Management Model (CanalMan).Maps of the command area and primary data used for simulations were collected from various sources. Maps were digitized using a geographical information system to determine accurate data. It is observed that there is oversupply to the system as compared to the crop water requirements during periods of low demand. Significant savings of irrigation water were found by using CBIO and night-time closure of canals. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CanalMan; CBIO; Closure; Downstream control system; GIS; Night-time; Pakistan; Upper swat",,"Ghumman, A.

Allelopathy and planting geometry are possible alternatives for achieving sustainable weed management and dry matter production. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of maize to allelopathy and planting geometry. Maize was planted in 75, 85 and 95 cm apart rows at New Developmental Farm, NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar during 2006. Three allelopathic crops, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and mungbean (Vigna radiate Wilczek) were intercropped in maize rows alongwith sole maize with no weeding (control) and sole maize with hand weed control. Row spacing and allelopathic crops significantly affected plant height, weeds density and weeds biomass. Maize row spacing of 75 cm produced taller plants height (161.0 cm) and maximum stalk (7093.7 kg ha-1), whereas in allelopathic crop treatments, maximum plant height (170.9 cm) and stalk yield (8854.1 kg ha-1) were produced by hand weed control treatment. Sorghum intercropped with maize suppressed weeds density and resulted in low biomass of deela (Cyprus rotundus L.), field bind weed (Convolvulus arvensis L.) and itsit (Trianthema portulacastrum L.) compared with other treatments. It may be inferred from this study that weeds were better suppressed by 75 cm row spacing and sorghum intercropped plots.",,"Convolvulus; Convolvulus arvensis; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus; Sorghum bicolor; Trianthema portulacastrum; Vigna; Zea mays","Khalil, S.

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with split plot design with three replications. Clipping was made before booting stage. The results obtained showed that the effect of clipping was significant forage yield, spike weight, spikelets per spike, 1000-grain weight, biological yield, grain yield and harvest index, while no differences were observed for plant height, tillers per m2 and spike length. Pirsabak-85 showed significantly higher plant height, while minimum was observed in Ghaznavi-98. Pirsabak-85 showed maximum number of tillers in clipped, while Fakhre-e-Sarhad in un-clipped treatment. In both cases, minimum tillers were recorded for SARC-3. Similarly, maximum spike weight was recorded in Pirsabak-85 and minimum in Dera-98. Likewise Pirsabak-85 showed significantly higher spikes length, while Takbeer showed significantly higher spike length in un-clipped. In both treatments, minimum spike length was recorded in Dera-98. Finally, grain yield, harvest index, spikelets per spike and spike weight were increased due to clipping, when compared with un-clipped treatments. To sum up, clipping at an early stage of vegetative growth produced almost higher grain yield with an additional forage yield.

Along the Pastaza and Urituyacu rivers in Peru, 100 informants in four villages knew 17 different uses of the piassaba fiber palm, Aphandra natalia (Balslev and Henderson) Barfod. Human consumption of fruits, extraction of fibers for trade, and harvesting leaves for thatch were the most frequently reported uses. Twenty uses were documented previously in the literature, and eight are reported here for the first time. Knowledge concerning the use of A. natalia among villagers varied significantly with ethnicity, village, and gender, but not with education or age; Amerindian informants knew more than non-Amerindian informants, and men knew more than women. Old and young informants knew about the same numbers of uses, and those who had little formal school training knew as many as those who had attended school for a longer time. Although 44% of our informants knew about fiber extraction, trade involving Aphandra fibers was not of great economic importance in our study area. Because fiber extraction has been documented as the most important use in all previous studies of A. natalia, it was surprising to find that people in one of the studied villages did not use A. natalia for that purpose at all. In contrast to previous observations, the extraction of fibers involved the destructive felling of the palms. We recommend implementing non-destructive extraction techniques so that local communities could exploit the fiber resource in a sustainable way. Non-destructive extraction methods involve cutting leaves from standing palms instead of felling the entire tree and leaving a few leaves on each extracted palm. However, given the limited economic incentive to the extractor, market mechanisms may be the greatest barrier to implementing sustainable extraction techniques. © 2009 The New York Botanical Garden.","Amazon; Amerindian knowledge; Ethnobotany; Indigenous uses; Non-timber forest products; NTFP; Palms","Aphandra; Aphandra natalia; Arecaceae","Balslev, H.; Department of Biological Sciences, Build. 1540, Ny Munkegade, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; email: henrik.balslev@biology.au.dk",,,00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

Field experiments were conducted on maize at the New Developmental Research Farm of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) Agricultural University Peshawar during summer 2002 (Y1) and 2003 (Y2) to investigate the effects of variable rates of N and its time of application on the net returns (NR) of maize (cultivar Azam) planted at low and high densities. The 2 × 3 × 6 factorial experiment was designed having two plant densities (D1 = 60,000 and D2 = 100,000 plants ha-1) and three N levels (N1 = 60, N2 = 120 and N3 = 180 kg N ha-1) as main plots, and six split N applications: two equal (S1), three unequal (S2), three equal (S3), four equal (S4), five equal (S5) and five unequal splits (S6) applied at sowing and with first, second, third, and fourth irrigation at 2 wk intervals as subplots. Maize planted at high density gave about 18% higher NR than at low density, and the increase in NR was comparatively more (3%) in the second growing season than the first growing season. Net returns showed positive relationship with increase in N rates, and increased by 19,565 and 31,948 PKR ha-1 with 120 and 180 kg N ha-1, respectively as compared with 60 kg N ha-1.

The worldwide increasing demand of mehedi leaf encourages many countries to adopt commercial farming of the plant. Farmers living in central Bangladesh recently commenced small-scale mehedi farming, primarily with the purpose of meeting national demand. A total of 182 farmers are engaged in mehedi farming and a study was conducted among 36 of them (a 20% random sample) to explore indigenous management techniques, marketing, livelihood potential and constraints of the enterprise. Farming was reported to be the major primary occupation of the study area. An average of 0. 05 ha land of the respondents was used for mehedi cultivation, which constituted 16. 7% of their average farm land. The farmers applied their own indigenous technology in every aspect of the farming, using branch cuttings as the only propagation material. The financial analysis indicated that mehedi farming is a profitable and attractive option for rural livelihoods [with an estimated net present value of Tk (Bangladeshi currency unit, 1 US $ = 68 Taka (as of May, 2009).) 179,500 for 0. 1 ha plantation]. However, the enterprise faces several constraints, including absence of a nursery for supplying planting materials, storage and effective marketing facilities, available capital for investment, improved technology, and above all, government support. If the government extends cooperation by assisting farmers with training, technology, credit and market development, mehedi farming could become an important revenue-earning enterprise in the small-scale cottage sector of Bangladesh. © Steve Harrison, John Herbohn 2009.","Bangladesh; Henna body art; Indigenous knowledge; Mehedi; NTFP","cultivation; farming system; indigenous knowledge; management practice; marketing; nontimber forest product; rural economy; small and medium-sized enterprise; Bangladesh; Lawsonia inermis","Koike, M.; Forest Policy Laboratory, 8304 Minamiminowa-Mura, 399-4598 Nagano-Ken, Japan; email: makoike@gipmc.shinshu-u.ac.jp",,,18737617,,,,"English","Small-scale For.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76649113734

A literature review was undertaken to unravel the historic drivers behind the formation of this protected area. Key informant interviews and questionnaire surveys were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of current governance approaches adopted by the park management authorities. Community-based questionnaire surveys and key-informant interviews focused on local communities' knowledge and awareness of the objectives of the park, people's role in decision-making, social characteristics, and resource use structures. The information from these surveys was evaluated within the context of good governance and sustainability of park management. Results show a lack of awareness and a low level of participation in protected area management, but a high degree of willingness in the communities to participate in conservation activities. An analysis of the survey data suggests that the park authorities enforce strict protection measures within the park, but this approach lacks a strong vision of sustainability. The surveys reveal that the local people have a very strong sense of belonging to the place and are willing to contribute to the protection of the PA. A large majority of the respondents rely on electronic media as their main source of information, which could potentially form the best medium for conservation campaigning in the region. With these findings in mind, we propose changes to the current governance model for effective and sustainable management of the park in the future. 2010 International Mountain Society.","Biodiversity; Chitral Gol National Park; Conservation and communities; Indigenous peoples; Mountain development; Pakistan; Protected areas governance","conservation planning; decision making; indigenous knowledge; indigenous population; literature review; national park; public attitude; questionnaire survey; resource use; sustainable development; Chitral Gol National Park; North West Frontier; Pakistan","Khan, M.

Yet integrated approaches to natural forest management remain elusive across the tropics. In this paper we examine one combination of uses: selective harvesting of timber and non-timber forest product (NTFP) extraction. We analyze the current status of this combination and speculate on prospects and challenges regarding: (i) resource inventory, (ii) ecology and silviculture, (iii) conflict in the use of multipurpose tree species, (iv) wildlife conservation and use, (v) tenure, and (vi) product certification. Our conclusions remain preliminary due to the relative paucity of published studies and lessons learned on what has worked and what has not in the context of integrated management for timber and NTFPs. We propose at least three ways where further research is merited. One, in improving 'opportunistic' situations driven by selective timber harvesting that also enhance NTFP values. Two, to explicitly enhance both timber and NTFP values through targeted management interventions. Three, to explicitly assess biophysical, social, regulatory and institutional aspects so that combined benefits are maximized. Interventions for enhancing the compatibility of timber and NTFP extraction must be scaled in relation to the size of the area being managed, applied timber harvesting intensities, and the dynamics of multi-actor, forest partnerships (e.g., between the private sector and local communities). In addition, training and education issues may have to be re-crafted with multiple-use management approaches inserted into tropical forestry curricula. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Much discussion has focused on the integration of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) into management, but less attention has been paid to identifying specific areas where it is most useful and where it may be most problematic.

The efficiency of deriving information from NTFP harvesters compared to scientific field studies was assessed. We further evaluated the potential of TEK to provide novel solutions to the management problem in question, the degree to which TEK could provide quantitative information, and the biases that might be associated with information derived from TEK. TEK complemented previously gathered ecological data by providing concordant and additional information, but also contradicted some results obtained using a scientific approach. TEK also gave a longer-term perspective with regard to NTFP harvesting patterns. Combining information on historical and current harvesting trends for the NTFP with official data suggests that current assessments of sustainability may be inaccurate and that the use of diverse information sources may provide an effective approach to assessing the status of harvested resources.

From its very genesis, the precise social and political dimensions of the state have been contested. If it is the “homeland” of the Muslims of South Asia then what status should it accord to its religious minorities, as well as to sub-state nations? How should it accommodate the demands of linguistic, sectarian, and regional minorities? Beyond the shared Islamic faith, what other attributes could serve as the constituent elements of nation building? And even if Islam constituted the unifying basis of the state, what role would it play in the everyday life and practices of its citizenry? These are questions to which the founders of the Pakistani state had paid scant attention. Yet they came to the fore almost immediately in the wake of Independence and Partition. They have also dogged the existence of the country ever since, and they have been the subject of vigorous and violent contestation (Ahmed, 1997). Sixty years after its creation, Pakistan is no closer to addressing these vital concerns. Instead they pose a continuing challenge to national identity and integration.

This article deals with the identification of suitable germination methods and the understanding of the seed storage behaviour, two pre-requisites for developing such propagation techniques. Moist filter paper appears to be a significantly better substrate for germination than sand. Pretreatment studies revealed that soaking in hot water (60°C) for 24 hours significantly improved the germination percentage from 83% to 98% on moist filter paper, and from 15% to 28% on sand. Pretreatment study coupled with microscopic studies indicated that about 14% of seeds were found to be hard seeded. Seeds could tolerate desiccation up to 10% moisture content (65% germination) while nil germination was recorded at 5% seed moisture content. The seeds were found to be chilling sensitive showing total mortality at 10°C. Seed deterioration studies showed rapid depletion of seed metabolites indicative of short viability. Based on storage behaviour, D. hamiltonii seeds could be classified as intermediate seeds. From seed perspective, the hard seed coat, the need for a well aerated substrate and the short viability could be the likely impeding factors for inadequate regeneration of the species. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Decalepis; Desiccation; Endangered; Intermediate; Pretreatment; Storage","desiccation; endangered species; germination; metabolite; moisture content; nontimber forest product; regeneration; root vegetable; seed; substrate; India; Decalepis hamiltonii","Anandalakshmi, R.; Institute of Forest Genetics and Tree Breeding, Coimbatore, India; email: lakshmir@icfre.org",,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

A multi-scale object based image analysis has been carried out for the forest cover assessment of the park. Image objects representing homogenous landscape components were delineated using image segmentation routine. This approach allows efficient inclusion of spatial concepts by segmenting the digital image according to image resolution and scale of expected objects. Following the multiresolution segmentation a classification tree was developed that used a fuzzy nearest neighbor classifier to assign respective class to image segments at their respective scale. After manual classification of unclassified or misclassified objects, overall accuracy of the final out put was around 90%. Keeping in view the operational advantages and limitation of object based technique of Definiens, the proposed methodology can be easily replicated to other parts of moist temperate Himalayan forests in Pakistan.

The study method included open-ended interviews with four District Forest Office (DFO) staff, 15 key informants, a socio-economic survey of 250 households, data collection on household consumption of forest products and an analysis of land cover changes from the years 1970 and 2000. Chepangs were found highly dependent on a forest whose area has decreased by 12%, resulting in a reduction in species used by the Chepang for their livelihoods. Economic development based on non-timber forest products (NTFPs) has potential to decrease forest dependency and help conservation but the oligopoly (a limited number of suppliers and sellers) nature of the market, policyrelated problems and limited DFO technical staff has prevented people from enjoying NTFP-based economic benefits. The Chepang traditional management practice was found to be environmentally friendly but at times of increased population pressure on the forest these traditions broke down. Lack of trust between Chepangs and non-Chepangs, and the absence of mediation from the DFO obstructed the formation of community organizations to manage the forest. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Chepang; Community-based forest management; Forest dependence; Indigenous peoples; Livelihood; Nepal",,"Rijal, A.; People Plant Protection, Pasanglhamu Sadak, Bauddha Mahankal-6, Kathmandu, Nepal; email: arunrijal@yahoo.com",,,14888386,,,,"English","Biodiversity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958466190

The bone mineral density of heel was measured by bone densitometer Osteoporosis was defined on basis of WHO criteria. Results: The mean age of menopause observed was 49.1±5.8 years. Early and late onset of menopause was associated with development of osteoporosis, while normal onset of menopause was found to be linked with osteopenia or bone mineral density remained normal. Only 14.48% women had normal bone mineral density. Approximate forty four percent postmenopausal women were suffering from osteopenia and 24.5% were having T-score in osteoporotic range. Conclusion: There is intense need to make women aware of osteoporosis, and its complications in form of fractures and lack of mobility. Osteoporotic bones can never be restored, so there should be early screening of menopausal women.","Menopause; Osteopenia; Osteoporosis; T-score","adult; age distribution; article; bone density; early menopause; female; human; major clinical study; menopause; osteopenia; osteoporosis; outpatient department; Pakistan; postmenopause; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor","Zahoor, S.; Department of Gynaecology, Pakistan",,,10135472,,,,"English","J.

A field experiment was conducted to study effects of urea spray on Azam variety of maize (Zea mays L.) in Mardan district of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan during 2005-06. The 5 × 4 factorial experiment was designed with five urea levels (U0 = control, U1 = 2, U2 = 4, U3 = 6 and U4 = 8% urea) applied to main plots and four application timings (T1 = at V9, T2 = V12, T3 = VT and T4 = R1 stages) assigned to subplots. Days to tasseling, silking, and maturity were delayed significantly when urea was applied at the rate of 6% and when applied at the V12 stage. Earlier tasseling, silking, and maturity were observed in urea control plots and in plots that received urea at the V9 stage. Plant height, leaf area, number of grains per cob and per line as well as (1000) grain weight, and grain and stover yields increased significantly up to the 6% urea level. Maize yield and yield components were higher when urea was applied at the V12 and VT stages than at the V9 and R1 stages. It is concluded that urea spray at the rate of 6% during the V12 stage would improve the grain yield and yield components of maize in the study area and contribute significantly to increased production. © Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Foliar urea; Maize; Yield; Yield components","Zea mays","Yasir, A.

Since the 1980s NW Yunnan Province has become the largest exporter of Matsutake in China, and money from their sale has become crucial to local livelihoods and to the provincial tax base. Amid fears of declining productivity, regulations have been enacted to control Matsutake harvest, though enforcement remains largely in the hands of harvesters themselves. Here, we measure local harvesters' perceptions of the ecological determinants of mushroom productivity in contrast to that of the outsider conservation community. We interview 122 harvesters in eight villages in Diqing province, NW Yunnan to determine what is perceived to be detrimental to Matsutake yield, how yield can be improved in the future and who harvesters trust for information. Our results indicate that village leaders and forestry officials are overwhelmingly the most trusted sources for information. Mann and Whitney U tests show general consensus among villages, and MRPP analysis shows general consensus within villages. One village showed significantly higher levels of trust in NGOs. Of the 86% of harvesters who had perceived declining productivity trends over the past 10 years, soil disturbance, climate change, and habitat degradation were most often-cited as causal factors. Log-linear analysis showed almost no significant interactions between perceptions and harvester demographics. Environmental protection and reducing soil disturbance were most often-cited as potentially increasing future yields. We suggest that local and outsider knowledge are complimentary in this system, and that forestry officials and village leaders provide the best conduits for management information. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The experiments were laid out in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with split plot arrangements having three replications. Four maize plant spacings (15, 20, 25 and 30 cm) were kept in main plots, while weed densities (3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 m-2) were allotted to sub plots. Narrow plant spacing of 15 cm produced higher grain yield of 2.85 and 2.66 t ha-1 as compared to 2.30 and 2.08 t ha-1 in wider plant spacing of 30 cm during 2006 and 2007, respectively. However, during both years, yield components of individual plants were negatively affected with a decrease in plant spacing. Similarly, control plots produced higher grain yield of 3.04 and 2.87 t ha-1as compared to grain yield of 2.14 and 2.0 t ha-1 in plots having weed density of 18 plants m-2 in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

Two years research showed that narrow spacing enhanced competitive ability of maize crop and suppressed weed growth, which eventually resulted in higher yield, depicting that T. portulacastrum is a strong competitor of maize and may cause substantial yield losses depending on plant spacing and weed density. Moreover, plant spacing alone is not effective to suppress T. portulacastrum; therefore, other cultural practices should also be integrated with narrow spacing to reduce yield losses in maize crop.",,"Equidae; Trianthema portulacastrum; Zea mays","Marwat, K.

Accomplishing these goals requires an understanding of how NTFPs are extracted, processed and marketed in rural areas. It is an important means for economic growth and sustainable forest management in local communities. Despite the potential of NTFPs in poverty reduction and livelihoods improvement in rural areas in Ghana, little is known about their collection, procession, packaging and labeling. This paper examines the supply chain and commercialization of NTFPs in rural settings in Ghana and their potential to contribute to poverty reduction, food security and livelihoods improvement. The study uses an exploratory and qualitative research methodology, including an extensive literature review, consultations with key informants, administration of questionnaires, interviews and stakeholder consultations. The results of the study indicated that NTFPs contribute significantly to the food security, poverty reduction and livelihoods development in Ghana. The marketing of these products, however, faces a number of critical processing, labeling and marketing challenges. The NTFPs marketing often occurs in an informal way, resulting in uncertainty about prices and yields. Marketing is basically done individually; it is unorganized, dispersed and farmers lack the necessary marketing skills and information required for optimal performance. Promoting the development and commercialization of these products on a permanent basis will enormously help to create more sustainable employment and income-generation opportunities, enhance food security and improve the livelihoods of farmers, their families and communities. The paper also identifies and analyses a number of critical factors that hinder the commercialization of NTFPs in Ghana and recommends strategies for redressing them.","Commercialization; Food security; Labeling; Livelihood improvement; Marketing; Non-timber forest products; Nutrition; Packaging; Poverty reduction; Processing","adult; aged; agricultural worker; agriculture; article; community; economic development; employment; environmental protection; family; female; food security; forest; Ghana; human; human experiment; income; industrial production; interview; male; marketing; non timber forest product; normal human; packaging; poverty; processing; qualitative research; questionnaire; rural population; uncertainty","Ahenkan, A.; Human Ecology Department, Laarbeeklaan 103, B1090 Jette, Brussels, Belgium; email: aahenkan@vub.ac.be",,"WFL Publisher Ltd.",14590255,,,,"English","J.

This report will be updated as events warrant. A U.S.-Pakistan relationship marked byperiods of both cooperation and discord was transformed by the September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and the ensuing enlistment of Pakistan as a key ally in U.S.-led counterterrorism efforts. Top U.S. officials have praised Pakistan for its ongoing cooperation, although long-held doubts exist about Islamabad's commitment to some core U.S. interests. Pakistan is identified as a base for terrorist groups and their supporters operating in Kashmir, India, and Afghanistan. Since 2003, Pakistan's army has conducted unprecedented and largely ineffectual counterterrorism operations in the country's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) bordering Afghanistan, where Al Qaeda operatives and pro-Taliban insurgents are said to enjoy ""safe haven."" Militant groups have only grown stronger and more aggressive in 2008. Islamabad's new civilian-led government vows to combat militancy in the FATA through a combination of military force, negotiation with ""reconcilable"" elements, and economic development. The Pakistani military has in late 2008 undertaken major operations aimed at neutralizing armed extremism in the Bajaur agency, and the government is equipping local tribal militias in several FATA agencies with the hope that these can supplement efforts to bring the region under more effective state writ. The upsurge of militant activity on the Pakistan side of the border is harming the U.S.-led stabilization mission in Afghanistan, by all accounts. U.S. commanders in Afghanistan attribute much of the deterioration in security conditions in the south and east over the past year to increased militant infiltration from Pakistan. U.S. policymakers are putting in place a series of steps to try to address the deficiencies of the Afghan government and other causes of support for Afghan Taliban militants, but they are also undertaking substantial new security measures to stop the infiltration. A key, according to U.S. commanders, is to reduce militant infiltration into Afghanistan from Pakistan. To do so, U.S. General David McKiernan, the overall commander in Afghanistan, is ""redefining"" the Afghan battlefield to include the Pakistan border regions, and U.S. forces are becoming somewhat more aggressive in trying to disrupt, from the Afghan side of the border, militant operational preparations and encampments on the Pakistani side of the border. At the same time, Gen. McKiernan and other U.S. commanders are trying to rebuild a stalled Afghanistan-Pakistan-U.S./NATO military coordination process, building intelligence and information sharing centers, and attempting to build greater trust among the senior ranks of the Pakistani military. Islamist extremism and militancy has been a menace to Pakistani society throughout the post-2001 period, becoming especially prevalent in 2007 and 2008. The numerous militant groups operating in Pakistan, many of which have in the past displayed mutual animosity, may be increasing their levels of coordination and planning. Moreover, a new generation of militants is comprised of battle-hardened jihadis with fewer allegiances to religious and tribal leaders and customs. Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte warned in late 2008 that, ""The United States and our allies face near-term challenges from Pakistan's reluctance and inability to roll back terrorist sanctuaries in the tribal region."" One Western press report called Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) ""the most ungoverned, combustible region in the world,"" and an unrelenting surge in Islamist-related violence in Pakistan has some observers fearing a total collapse of the Pakistani state.1 This untenable state of affairs is compounded by Pakistan's deteriorating economic conditions.2 In 2008, the influence of Islamist militants appears to have grown unchecked in large parts of Pakistan beyond the FATA, bringing insecurity even to the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) capital of Peshawar, which reportedly is in danger of being overrun by pro-Taliban militants. In late 2008, militants in the region have attempted to assassinate the U.S. Consul General in Peshawar and undertook the targeted killing of an American aid worker there. Other so-called ""settled areas"" of Pakistan beyond the tribal regions have come under attack from pro-Taliban militants. Indeed, the ""Talibanization"" of western Pakistan appears to be ongoing and may now threaten the territorial integrity of the Pakistani state. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Most communities make a living either through their domestic or commercial use. The objective of this study was to review the current status of the NTFP sector and further compile an up-to-date list of major use categories of NTFPs. The review of the national study on the NTFP sector indicate an average annual value of the selected NTFPs groups of between US$19.8 million and US$79 million with a median value of US$49.38 million. The most important group from an economic point of view is medicinal plants with an average annual value of US$32.1 million, followed by fuel wood with an estimated annual value of US$13.5 million. In the natural accounting study it was revealed that the contribution of natural forests and woodlands in flow benefits, including the highlighted NTFPs, was equivalent to 2.2% of the total GDP, 20% of agriculture's GDP and 439% of the contribution of forestry reported in the national accounts for 2000. This current study reviewed past national, regional and international studies and developed a new list of 19 NTFP use categories subdivided into direct, indirect and intermediate uses. Subsequently, a matrix of commonly used botanical NTFPs was designed and includes most highly preferred species such as Sclerocarya birrea, Bauhinia galpinii, Berchemia zeyheri, Dichrostachys cinerea and others. However, the study concluded that there is still a profound lack of information on the status and total value of NTFPs in Swaziland and recommended that government, NGOs, the private sector, communities, and other interested and affected parties (including resource users) should work together to conduct research in order to generate, compile and disseminate information on the quantitative and qualitative statistical data on NTFPs, their socioeconomic uses and ecological and environmental values. © NISC (Pty) Ltd.","Economic valuation; Plant species; Sustainable management; Use categories","Bauhinia; Bauhinia galpinii; Berchemia zeyheri; Dichrostachys cinerea; Sclerocarya birrea","Dlamini, C.

A total of 4548 serum samples collected from 26 locations of the NWFP including. Eight hundred twenty eight samples were found positive for PPR antibodies yielding an overall seroprevalence of 18.20 percent in the small ruminant population included in the study. 337 (24.90%) serum samples from sheep and 491 (15.36%) from goats were found positive in PPR c-ELISA yielding a marginal difference in seroprevalence of PPR. The current situation of PPR in Pakistan could be regarded as of low magnitude but constant threat. Incidence may increase to the alarming level due to uncontrolled/ free movement within and from across boarders to the stocks of non-immunized susceptible population of sheep and goats in the country but production systems and economic realities constraint the effective animal movement control within and across the boarders. Based on the limited reports of outbreaks and uneven distribution of occurrence over the years of past decade, the best available options are high level of prevention and objective surveillance. Keeping in view the high risk of PPR, control strategy should be adopted and further study needs to be undertaken to ascertain the extent of PPR virus circulating in the population of goats and sheep in the country. Under existing production and marketing system, sanitation and preventive vaccination are two practicable options for control of PPR in Pakistan. Homologous PPR vaccine is now available which is a freeze dried live vaccine derived from tissue culture from attenuated PPR virus. The vaccine is intended for sheep and goats and is required to be injected to all animals above the age of 3 month. The vaccine may be repeated after one year of the primary vaccination in high risk areas.","Competitive-ELISA; Goat; Peste des petits ruminants; Seroprevalence; Sheep; Virus",,"Gadahi, J.A.; National Veterinary Laboratories, Park Road, Islamabad, Pakistan; email: drgadahi@yahoo.com",,,09728988,,,,"English","Vet.

This study focused on Ngoi district of Luang Phabang province in northern Laos where there is a long history of non-timber forest product (NTFP) trading in the study area. In the Lān Xāng Kingdom era, political coordinators called Lām collected agro-forest products from mountain people as tax, and private traders purchased NTFPs, mainly benzoin and cardamom. Then, under the communist regime in the period between and, private traders were replaced by government-managed stores and the role of the Lām disappeared. After the Lao version of Perestroika or Chintanakan Mai in, private agro-forest product trading was re-established in the study area and in addition, general stores and periodic markets appeared along the riverside. The re-establishment of agroforest product trading resulted from the stimulation of commodity flows due to the local general stores and periodic markets, and vice versa. During the Chintanakan Mai period, the NTFPs being traded in the study area were not traditional foods or medicines but rather new products being exported to foreign countries, especially China. The borders with Thailand, China, and Vietnam in northern Laos were re-opened in the early s, after which Chinese traders came directly to northern Laos to purchase NTFPs. This paper shows how the stimulation of human mobility, commodity distribution, and information flow observed after Chintanakan Mai has strongly affected the livelihood of the mountain people.","Agro-forest product trading; Commercial activity; Northern Laos; NTFP; Periodic market","agroforestry; commercial activity; international trade; mountain region; nontimber forest product; trade flow; Laos; Luang Prabang; Elettaria cardamomum","Satoshi, Y.; Department of Geography, , Nagoya 464-8601, Japan; email: s-yokoyama@nagoya-u.jp",,,05638682,,,,"English","Southeast Asian Stud.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149382058

Paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) is an important NTFP in many parts of northern Laos, providing opportunities for earning cash income, particularly for women. Since the plant has been successfully domesticated by local people, it has also been widely proposed as the basis for a sustainable agro forestry system. The major objectives of this article are to investigate the production, processing and marketing system of paper mulberry and to assess its potential to contribute to building sustainable rural livelihoods in northern Lao PDR. We also elucidate how this perennial plant has been affected by recent government policies, changes in resource management - from gathering to domestication - and current land use transitions, drawing on a case study from PhaOudom district, Bokeo province, northern Laos. Whether a sustainable production and supply-chain management system for paper mulberry can be developed that provides a reliable - albeit modest - source of income for many ethnic minority villagers in northern Laos will largely depend on the capacity of local producers to enhance product quality and to become more active and equal actors in the value chain, but most of all on the political will of the Lao government to rethink its controversial agriculture and forest policies that aim at reducing agricultural diversity and restrict access to NTFPs through resettlement of formerly forest-dependent communities.","Agro forestry systems; Non-timber forest products; Northern Lao PDR; Paper mulberry; Rural livelihoods","agricultural policy; agroforestry; deciduous tree; income; land use; market system; nontimber forest product; perennial plant; resource management; sustainable development; Bokeo; Laos; Broussonetia; Broussonetia papyrifera","Neef, A.; Faculty of Agriculture, , Fukuoka, Japan; email: aneef@agr.kyushu-u.ac.jp",,,05638682,,,,"English","Southeast Asian Stud.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958245473

This paper uses an indices method based on participant ranking of species to quantify use-values of Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) and the socio-economic factors that influence these values for people living around the Pendjari Biosphere Reserve in Benin. There were 76 species identified that had a high index value to people. The 10 most valued species were Parkia biglobosa, Adansonia digitata, Vitellaria paradoxa, Tamarindus indica, Lannea microcarpa, Vitex doniana, Hibiscus asper, Melochia corchorifolia, Khaya senegalensis, and Diospyros mespiliformis. Species values were influenced by the vegetative form of the species as well as by the gender of a participant and his/her affiliation to the ethnic group. The study also illustrates that women had a preference for NTFP species with high commercial and nutritional values, while men preferred plants that provide construction material and medicine. Moreover, the ethnic group that historically had more contact and interaction with the vegetation valued NTFPs more than any other group. The difference in value attributed to species by people was also driven by the vertical transmission of ethnobotanical knowledge in the study area. For long-term biodiversity conservation, it will be useful to involve the needs of all of the local communities in the design of a management plan and focus attention on the most important species. © 2009 The New York Botanical Garden.","Benin; Local values; Non-timber forest products; Pendjari biosphere reserve","Adansonia; Adansonia digitata; Diospyros; Diospyros mespiliformis; Hibiscus; Hibiscus asper; Khaya senegalensis; Lannea microcarpa; Melochia corchorifolia; Parkia biglobosa; Tamarindus indica; Vitellaria paradoxa; Vitex; Vitex doniana","Vodouhê, F.

Azam) on a P-deficient soil (6.6 mg P kg-1) at New Developmental Agricultural Research Farm, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) Agricultural University, Peshawar, Pakistan, during summer 2006 in wheat-maize cropping system. Physiological maturity was delayed, plant height was increased and leaf area was decreased significantly when maize was planted at highest (D4) than at lowest plant density (D1). Application of SSP resulted in earlier physiological maturity of maize than other P fertilizers. Grain and stover yield, harvest index, shelling percentage, thousand grain weight and grains ear-1 were maximized at D3 (80,000 plants ha-1) and with application of P fertilizer. Highest benefit in growth and grain yield was obtained with application of DAP to maize planted at D3. Application of DAP at D3 gave 15, 29, and 19% higher grain yield than its application at D1, D2, and D4, respectively.

Management of NTFPs through CFUGs is an important poverty-reduction strategy in rural Nepal. National policy documents encourage management of NTFPs by CFUGs for commercial purposes, particularly by involving marginalized communities. It is therefore important to understand the existing mechanisms of their involvement. We followed a case study approach and collected data through key informant interviews, focus group discussions, formal and informal discussions, participant observations, and study of secondary data, such as the constitutions and operational plans of the CFUGs. Because institutional arrangements varied across the 3 study CFUGs, the ability of marginalized people to benefit from the commercial management of NTFPs also differed. Results suggest that the involvement of external agencies, and the consequent conducting of NTFP-based pro-poor programs, positively influences commercial management of NTFPs and minimizes elite domination. Likewise, inclusion of representatives of marginalized people in the CFUG executive committees empowers them to lobby with external agencies for pro-poor programs. Furthermore, the geographic location of the community forest limits the involvement of external agencies and marketing of NTFPs. Therefore, because members of CFUGs in remote areas are heavily dependent on collection and sale of NTFPs for their livelihoods, we suggest increasing the focus of external agencies in such areas and including marginalized people in CFUG executive committees. © International Mountain Society 2009.","Community forest user groups (CFUGs); Inclusion; Institutional arrangements; Nepal; NGOs; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Pro-poor programs","forest management; forest resource; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; Nepal","Gauli, K.; Centre for Development Research, Gregor Mendel Straße 33, Vienna, Austria; email: kalyan.gauli@boku.ac.at",,,02764741,,,,"English","Mt.

However, issues of equity between various forest users are becoming a major challenge to environmental development, forest management and poverty reduction. This paper presents an analysis of household representatives' socio-economic determinants and other constraints on accessing forest products, based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 1865 respondents in seven districts of the Sissili province, southern Burkina Faso. Three logistic regression models were developed to examine determinants of access to the forest for collecting fuelwood, grazing livestock and collecting non-timber forest products (NTFPs). The results showed that access to forest products is associated with individual characteristics. Age, ethnicity, occupation and sources of income were significant determinants of access to all types of forest products. Access to the forest for grazing livestock was further influenced by gender and household size, while access to NTFPs was influenced by gender, household size and education level of the respondents. The formal forest law that precludes grazing in the forest, and customary rules and regulations pertaining to land tenure, were reported to be serious constraints to forest access for women and migrant people. Understanding the factors influencing access to products from commonly-owned forest resources could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments that promote equitable access. Policies should particularly encourage the direct involvement of vulnerable and marginalized groups (women and migrants) in forest management activities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Cultivars mean values manifested highly significant differences for all the traits except locules boll-1. Genetic potential of cultivars for different parameters revealed plant height (137.30 to 155.30 cm), bolls sympodia-1 (2.28 to 3.31), bolls plant-1 (14.00 to 25.95), boll weight (3.07 to 4.16 g), locules boll-1 (4.30 to 4.48) and seed cotton yield (1200 to 2450 kg ha-1). Genetic variances were found almost greater than the environmental variances for all the traits except bolls sympodia-1 and locules boll-1. High broad sense heritability (H2) and genetic gain were recorded for plant height (0.94, 9.41 cm), bolls sympodia-1 (0.81, 0.44), bolls plant-1 (0.96, 6.63), boll weight (0.96, 0.64 g) and seed cotton yield (0.98, 643.16 kg), respectively.

Contribution of different NTFPs to cash income and different seasonal access to NTFPs between Baka and Daka were analysed. There were significant differences in income and role of NTFPs per household between Baka and Daka related to different access to: NTFPs in forests, labour and market sales in different seasons. In Baka, the ranking of NTFP income was: fungi, wild vegetables, bamboo shoot in 2000 and 2001. Differences in gender and generational involvement in NTFP sales was also examined. For example, households without a son, as well as those with a female householder depended more on income from NTFPs and less on income from rubber than other households. Resource use patterns between relatively wealthy and poor households were also analysed. Wealthy households sold 2.50 ± 0.50 types while poor households sold 2.08 ± 0.26 NTFPs. The Gini coefficient of gross income per household for Baka in recent years was 0.393, increasing to 0.414 without NTFPs. The Gini coefficient of gross income for Daka in recent years was 0.291, increasing to 0.292 without NTFPs, showing the different role of NTFPs in mitigating wealth inequality in the two villages. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Gini coefficient; Household demography; NTFP income; Rubber plantation; Smallholder livelihood","fungus; household income; household survey; labor market; public access; questionnaire survey; rainforest; rubber; smallholder; vegetable; Baka; China; Daka; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan; Fungi","Fu, Y.; Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, , Mengla 666300, Yunnan, China; email: fuyn@xtbg.ac.cn",,,13504509,,IJSDB,,"English","Int.

The study examines the trends in urbanization, city growth and women's share in rural to urban migration. A profile of migrant women and their contribution in improving the quality of the life have also been examined through quantitative and qualitative approaches. The finding of the study reveals that due to decreasing dependency on agricultural sector, the rural population continued to shifting to cities, leading to an increase in urbanization. It also reveals that Rural to urban growth affects the level of urbanization. In addition urban population is spread uneventfully between the four provinces; Sindh is the most urbanized province while the least urbanizes province is NWFP. Further more slum and marginal human settlements have spread in urban localities. In the analysis, the role of migration in improving the quality of life has been assessed by five indicators; female labour force participation, income differentials of working migrants before and after migration, household consumption expenditures of migrants compared with those of non-migrants, infant mortality, and child malnutrition. Urban migration has made a difference in the lives of women and their families.

Thus, forest managers are never clear about how well their efforts are protecting such plants. We quantified abundance and edge-related variation in 91 species of useful wild plants commonly harvested by communities around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, to evaluate the effect of their harvest. Forty percent of these species were harvested exclusively for medicines, 22% for weaving, and 24% for other uses. Fourteen percent were harvested for combinations of uses. Plants were surveyed around the entire periphery of the park transects that extended out 1 km into the forest interior from the edge. Analyses of edge and interior distribution were controlled for effects of topography. Individually, nine (10%) species were very rare, occurring in <0.5% of the plots searched. Of the remaining 82 species, most (50%) decreased significantly away from the park boundary, whereas 4.9% increased and 45.1% showed no pronounced edge-related distributions. Rarer species were no more likely to be less abundant near the edge than commoner species. These results suggest that most plants used for nontimber purposes in BINP are not currently being harvested unsustainably. In this respect many of the species of useful wild plants we examined resembled animals commonly hunted in tropical forests for bushmeat because they increased in abundance in disturbed habitat. Conservation action should initially aim to understand what influences distributions of very rare species. Edge-based assessments of distributions may be valuable for revealing harvest impact on species of useful wild plants commonly harvested by people living around forest islands in the tropics. © 2009 Society for Conservation Biology.","Edge effects; Forest disturbance; Harvest impact; Medicinal plants; Nontimber forest products; NTFP; Tropical forests; Wild plants","edge effect; forest management; harvesting; medicinal plant; national park; nontimber forest product; topographic effect; tropical forest; wild population; article; ecosystem; medicinal plant; species difference; Uganda; Ecosystem; Plants, Medicinal; Species Specificity; Uganda; Africa; Bwindi Impenetrable National Park; East Africa; Southern Province [Uganda]; Sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda; Animalia","Olupot, W.; Institute of Tropical Forest Conservation, P.O.

Two different organisational models in mushrooms marketing-a 'traditional approach' and a 'net-system approach'-are compared through a case-study research approach. The first model is usually based on single large-scale enterprises producing large quantities of standardized, mass-market oriented products; its main commercial goal is the improvement of the value-chain from producer to end-users, with no special links or integration between the production area and the producers. The second, quite new approach is based on several integrated small and medium-scale rural-based enterprises supplying relatively limited quantities of high quality products, oriented to niche markets. In this case, product specialty identification, complementary actions, integration, and clustering among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) within the same production area are the most important goals. In the case studies, both organisational models have proved to be feasible and working with respect to the respective goals. Traditional large-scale enterprises, based on vertical integration and a short value chain, can achieve substantial economic performance; however, these are unlikely to have a significant positive impact on the socio-economic local context and are threatened by high business risk (mainly due to its strong specialization on a 'climate-dependent' NWFP). The analysed forest-based business model founded on networking, which involves not only forest-based SMEs but also other institutional, economic, and social actors, has proved to be not only economically viable and less risky with respect to the traditional model, but also more equitable in distribution of benefits, and effective in stimulating the local economy as a whole, integrated system based on NWFPs and related environmental services. © 2009 Steve Harrison, John Herbohn.","Mass markets; Networks; Niche-markets; SMEs; Territorial marketing","agroforestry; commercialization; forest product; marketing; mushroom; small and medium-sized enterprise; smallholder; Basidiomycota","Secco, L.; Department of TESAF, Via dell'Università 16, 35020 Legnaro, Italy; email: laura.secco@unipd.it",,,18737617,,,,"English","Small-scale For.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449103880

By law, 80% of this land must remain as standing forest. In this study, we examine the potential for timber harvesting through company-community partnerships (CCPs) as a means to increase forest-based revenue without compromising household use of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Using participatory rural appraisal, resource diaries, and household questionnaires, we study the impacts of CCP logging contracts on livelihoods, including household income and NTFP harvests. Our results show that annual household income from the CCP logging is equivalent to more than 8 years of household gross income from agricultural production. We also found that there were no significant differences in NTFP harvests between households with CCP logging and those without. In CCP-logging communities, households caught 11.9 ± 13.6 game animals, totaling 74 ± 88 kg of game meat. In the communities without CCP, households caught 9.5 ± 13.0 game animals, totaling 73 ± 172 kg of game meat. Annual forest fruit harvests averaged 9.8 ± 13.2 kg in CCP-logging communities and 13.5 ± 15.9 kg in non-CCP communities.

Selective logging for timber is increasingly taking place in forests where the collection of Brazil nuts, a high-value Amazonian NTFP, also occurs. We report on logging damage to Brazil nut trees in three certified timber concessions in Northern Bolivia from which timber is harvested using reduced-impact logging (RIL) guidelines and nuts are gathered yearly from the ground by local people. Observed frequencies of logging damage to Brazil nut trees were low, likely mirroring the low intensity of timber harvesting (∼0.5 trees/ha and ∼5 m3/ha) being currently applied across the study area. Of the trees ≥10 cm in diameter at breast height about 0.1 Brazil nut trees and 0.4 timber species per hectare suffered some degree of logging damage. Crown loss was the predominant damage type for Brazil nut trees accounting for 50% of all damage. In spite of the observed low rates of tree damage, we further recommend that RIL guidelines be amended to include the pre-harvest marking of pre-reproductive Brazil nut trees along with the future crop trees of commercial timber species. Further refining directional felling to reduce crown damage to Brazil nut trees would also serve to help maintain nut yields in the long term. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

While the destruction of the Miombo has often been blamed on the rural communities dwelling near the forest resources, many urban dwellers depend heavily on the various products derived from the woodlands. This paper highlights the importance of the Miombo in the livelihoods of rural people, the potential threats to this ecosystem and opportunities for its sustainable management. About 70% of energy consumed in southern Africa is in the form of fuelwood or charcoal. The economic importance of the Miombo especially from non-timber forest products (NTFPs) is usually understated due to their perceived non-economic value yet they play an important role in sustaining livelihoods of forest dependent people in the miombo ecoregion. The Miombo also contributes to health services through the use of medicinal plant and products, in some cases, contributing up to 80% to rural health, including helping in coping with effects of HIV/ AIDS, malaria and several diseases. The possibility of developing payment for environmental services schemes through public-private partnerships, and community-based sustainable management models are proposed. Through conservation and commercialization of some of the products and services, there is a potential to provide income and improve the livelihood of people involved in the trade along the value chain. © 2009 United Nations.","Charcoal; Commercialization; Development-conservation trade-off; Natural resource conflicts; NTFPs; Policy gaps; Sustainable livelihoods","charcoal; commercialization; ecosystem management; nature conservation; nontimber forest product; policy analysis; resource management; sustainability; trade-off; woodland; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa","Syampungani, S.; Copperbelt University, , Kitwe, Zambia; email: syampungani@cbu.ac.zm",,,01650203,,,,"English","Nat.

Theoretically, the fragmented population should show low diversity within population and higher diversity among population with low rate of gene flow. To test this hypothesis, we conducted diversity analysis of 7 populations of W. coagulans from the districts of Kohat and Karak in NWFP (North West Frontier Province), Pakistan using PBA (P450 based analogue) markers. Our results showed contrary findings from the hypothesis for fragmented population. The findings showed higher diversity within population and lower diversity among population like larger unfragmented populations even though the population size was less than 100 in all populations. Percentage of polymorphic bands (PPB) in these populations was 50 to 71.95% with gene diversity (H) of 0.192 to 0.298. AMOVA (Analysis of molecular variance) test showed that there was low genetic diversity among populations (17%) and high genetic diversity within population (83%). F ST value showed low genetic differentiation (0.0911) and high gene flow (Nm 2.494) among populations. Isolation by Distance Model revealed no correlation between genetic and geographic distances as well as ecotypes (soil variation) vs genetic distances. Presumably, the larger fragments, formed long time ago due to geological changes, were reduced into smaller fragments recently due to the human pressure. the fruits of the plant are exploited for commercial purposes and the whole plant is used as fodder and fuelwood thus threatening the current survival of the limited fragmented populations.

A questionnaire, consisting of designation of respondent and questions regarding status of HBV vaccination, was distributed among the staff to be filled by the staff; in some cases, authors asked the questions directly and filled the questionnaire accordingly. Results: Four hundred and eighty-three staff, including 314 males and 169 females were interviewed. Out of these, 317 (65.63%) were immunized against hepatitis B virus whereas 166 (34.37%) were not (p = < 0.05). Among the vaccinated participants, 150 (47.32%) families were immunized whereas 21 (12.57%) families were immunized among the non immunized participants (p = < 0.05). Frequency of immunization was highest in the teaching staff (96.55%) and lowest in the canteen and security staff (10%) (p = < 0.05). The source of vaccination was mostly (87.5%) from hospital (p = < 0.05). Conclusion: Though 65.63% staff is vaccinated against hepatitis B virus in LRH Peshawar of NWFP, yet more aggressive and combined efforts are needed to vaccinate the 34.37% staff who is not protected.","Family members; Hepatitis B immunization; Source of vaccination; Staff","hepatitis B vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; adult; article; controlled study; descriptive research; female; health personnel attitude; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hospital personnel; hospital service; human; interview; male; Pakistan; questionnaire; vaccination; attitude to health; family; health status; hospital personnel; infection prevention; laboratory personnel; medical personnel; normal human; nursing staff; nursing student; paramedical personnel; teacher; vaccination; attitude to illness; health promotion; health survey; medical staff","Ahmed, H.; Medical 'A' Unit, , Peshawar, Pakistan",,,10135472,,,,"English","JPMI J.

It is spreading rapidly. The sore of OWCL may be a non-ulcerative red papule, nodule or a large mutilating ulcer. The ulcer is typically painless and can leave a disfiguring scar. METHODS: This was a descriptive study. The diagnosis of OWCL was established by finding LD bodies in skin smear preparation. RESULTS: This study identified 1680 cutaneous leishmaniasis in 1767 skin ulcers. Children (n = 924) were infected more than other age groups (n = 756). There were typical skin sore of OWCL in 1512 cases while 168 patients had atypical presentation. The ulcers were painless in 1603 patients. History of insect bite was present in 1366 cases, thorn prick in 156 patients, religious visit to endemic areas in 256 patients, and 4 patients had post surgical non healing wound. Lesions with 4 to 6 months of age had a maximum yield of LD bodies. There were 498 patients from different areas of Peshawar; 688 cases from leishmania endemic belt of FATA while 89 patients came from other urban and rural areas of NWFP. CONCLUSIONS: There is a tremendous increase in cases of OWCL and the disease became endemic in many regions of Pakistan. The bordering areas along Afghanistan have constituted an endemic belt that had invaded the neighboring urban and rural areas. Several chronic non healing ulcers had been diagnosed as OWCL. Many cases have been detected in Peshawar. People need education about the nature of the diseases and the efficacy of personal protective measures.

Al-Qaeda continues to pose the most serious terrorist threat to the U.S. today. If the September 11, 2001 attacks have taught us anything, it is that al-Qaeda is most dangerous when it has a sanctuary or safe haven from which to plan and plot attacks. Al-Qaeda has acquired such a sanctuary in Pakistan's Federal Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and its North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and surrounding environs. Accordingly, the highest priority for the new American presidential administration must be to refocus our-and our allies'-attention on Afghanistan and Pakistan, where al-Qaeda began to collapse after 2001, but has now re-grouped. This will entail understanding that al-Qaeda and its local militant jihadi allies cannot be defeated by military means alone. Success will require a dual strategy of systematically destroying and weakening enemy capabilities-that is, continuing to kill and capture al-Qaeda commanders and operatives-along with breaking the cycle of terrorist recruitment among radicalized ""bunches of guys"" as well as more effectively countering al-Qaeda's effective information operations. The U.S. thus requires a strategy that harnesses the overwhelming kinetic force of the American military as part of a comprehensive vision to transform other, non-kinetic instruments of national power in order to deal more effectively with irregular and unconventional threats. This article first discusses the scope and details of the terrorist threat today and then proposes a counterterrorism strategy for the new presidential administration. It focuses first on creating a micro approach to address the deteriorating situation in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. It then considers the requirements of a broader macro strategy to counter terrorism and insurgency. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afghanistan; Counterinsurgency; Counterterrorism; Global war on terrorism; Inter-agency coordination; Obama presidential administration counterterrorism options; Pakistan; Strategy; Terrorism",,"Hoffman, B.; Georgetown University, Mortara Building, 3600 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20007, United States; email: brh6@georgetown.edu",,,09546553,,,,"English","Terrorism Polit.

Some years ago, most forest enterprises exclusively focused on wood production, whereas today, forest management is expected to be multifunctional and economically as well as socially and ecologically sustainable [Harrison, S., Herbohn, J., Niskanen, A., 2002. Non-industrial, smallholder, small-scale and family forestry: what's in a name? Small-scale Forest Economics. Management and Policy 1 (1), 1-11; Schmithuesen, F., 2004.

Towards the sustainable use of Europe's forests: Forest ecosystems and landscape research: Joensuu: European Forest Institute, Proc., vol. 49, pp. 87-99]. In this context, non-timber forest products (NTFPs) such as forest honey, mushrooms, or berries could gain importance as an additional source of income for the forestry sector. To assess the market potential of NTFPs in Switzerland, two corresponding surveys were conducted. A consumer survey (N = 897) conducted in six cities in Switzerland investigated the purchase of Swiss NTFPs, consumer preferences, and demand potentials. An additional survey of sellers of NTFPs (N = 105) looked at these aspects from a complementary perspective. The results showed that there is a high esteem and considerable demand potential for such products among urban consumers. Food products were mentioned most frequently. Both consumers and sellers considered quality and environmental friendliness the most important attributes of NTFPs. Structural and organizational innovations and considerable marketing efforts and sales promotion would be required to expand the market for Swiss NTFP, however. Our results indicate that certification of the products' origin, environmental performance, and quality could support such efforts and that recreational and ecological forest services have a synergetic potential for the marketing of NTFPs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We report results of irrigated crop rotation experiment, conducted in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan, during 1999-2002 to evaluate effects of residue retention, fertilizer N application and mung bean (Vigna radiata) on crop and N yields of wheat and soil organic fertility in a mung bean-wheat sequence. Treatments were (a) crop residue retained (+residue) or (b) removed (-residue), (c) 120 kg N ha-1 applied to wheat, (d) 160 kg N ha-1 to maize or (e) no nitrogen applied. The cropping system was rotation of wheat with maize or wheat with mung bean. The experiment was laid out in a spit plot design. Postharvest incorporation of crop residues significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the grain and straw yields of wheat during both years. On average, crop residues incorporation increased the wheat grain yield by 1.31 times and straw yield by 1.39 times. The wheat crop also responded strongly to the previous legume (mung bean) in terms of enhanced grain yield by 2.09 times and straw yield by 2.16 times over the previous cereal (maize) treatment. Application of fertilizer N to previous maize exerted strong carry over effect on grain (1.32 times) and straw yield (1.38 times) of the following wheat. Application of N fertilizer to current wheat produced on average 1.59 times more grain and 1.77 times more straw yield over the 0 N kg ha-1 treatment. The N uptake in wheat grain and straw was increased 1.31 and 1.64 times by residues treatment, 2.08 and 2.49 times by mung bean and 1.71 and 1.86 times by fertilizer N applied to wheat, respectively. The soil mineral N was increased 1.23 times by residues, 1.34 times by mung bean and 2.49 times by the application of fertilizer N to wheat. Similarly, the soil organic C was increased 1.04-fold by residues, 1.08 times by mung bean and 1.00 times by the application of fertilizer N. We concluded that retention of residues, application of fertilizer N and involvement of legumes in crop rotation greatly improves the N economy of the cropping system and enhances crop productivity in low N soils. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this study was to determine whether micro-watershed treatment can improve rainfall use efficiency and yield of wheat under rainfed condition. Field trials were conducted during 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 under rainfed condition at Cereal Crops Research Institute Pirsabak, NWFP (Northwest Frontier Province) Pakistan. Five micro-watershed, raised 0.45-0.5 m above ground level, were treated with either (1) plastic sheets, (2) stones, (3) compacted soil, (4) un-compacted soil, (5) left as untreated control. The experiment was conducted according to randomized complete block (RCB) design with six replications. Micro-watershed treatments significantly affected emergence m-2, days to 50% heading, plant height, spikes m-2, grains spike-1, grain yield and rainfall use efficiency. Maximum emergence m-2 (83.1) and plant height (94.7 cm) were recorded from micro-watershed treatments covered with plastic sheet, while maximum spikes m-2 (173.8), grains spike-1 (56.0), grain yield (2394 kg ha-1) and rainfall use efficiency (6.22) were recorded from micro-watersheds treatments covered with stones. Maximum days to 50% heading (116.4) were recorded in control plots. Micro-watershed enhanced days to 50% heading (114.5).

Therefore, avian diversity was studied during the spring and fall of 2005 and 2006 on farmlands in eastern Québec, Canada. The study focused on 12-year-old windbreaks, half of which comprised shrubs that produce non-timber forest products (NTFP). The main objectives were (1) to determine whether the introduction of NTFP into windbreaks influences bird abundance, richness and diversity; (2) to verify if NTFP attract potentially detrimental birds; and (3) to determine the habitat variables that best explain the use of windbreaks by birds. Traditional windbreaks (n = 7) were composed of larches (Larix laricina (Du Roi) Koch.) alternating with ashes (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh. or Fraxinus americana L.), while the windbreaks with shrubs that produce NTFP (n = 7) included American elderberries (Sambucus canadensis L.) and highbush cranberries (Viburnum trilobum Marsh.) instead of L. laricina. No difference was found in bird abundance, diversity or richness between the two types of windbreaks, except for greater richness during springtime in windbreaks without NTFP, probably due to larches providing greater tree cover. In both windbreak types, the vast majority (>94%) of the birds belonged to the non-detrimental bird class. Bird use was positively influenced by the presence of ditches along the windbreak. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Al-Qaeda continues to pose the most serious terrorist threat to the U.S. today. If the September 11, 2001 attacks have taught us anything, it is that al-Qaeda is most dangerous when it has a sanctuary or safe haven from which to plan and plot attacks. Al-Qaeda has acquired such a sanctuary in Pakistan's Federal Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and its North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and surrounding environs. Accordingly, the highest priority for the new American presidential administration must be to refocus our-and our allies'-attention on Afghanistan and Pakistan, where al-Qaeda began to collapse after 2001, but has now re-grouped. This will entail understanding that al-Qaeda and its local militant jihadi allies cannot be defeated by military means alone. Success will require a dual strategy of systematically destroying and weakening enemy capabilities-that is, continuing to kill and capture al-Qaeda commanders and operatives-along with breaking the cycle of terrorist recruitment among radicalized ""bunches of guys"" as well as more effectively countering al-Qaeda's effective information operations. The U.S. thus requires a strategy that harnesses the overwhelming kinetic force of the American military as part of a comprehensive vision to transform other, non-kinetic instruments of national power in order to deal more effectively with irregular and unconventional threats. This article first discusses the scope and details of the terrorist threat today and then proposes a counterterrorism strategy for the new presidential administration. It focuses first on creating a micro approach to address the deteriorating situation in both Afghanistan and Pakistan. It then considers the requirements of a broader macro strategy to counter terrorism and insurgency. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Afghanistan; Counterinsurgency; Counterterrorism; Global war on terrorism; Inter-agency coordination; Obama presidential administration counterterrorism options; Pakistan; Strategy; Terrorism",,"Hoffman, B.; School of Foreign Service Security Studies Program, Mortara Building, 3600 N Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20007, United States; email: brh6@georgetown.edu",,,09540253,,,,"English","Gender Educ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449369421

Azam) planted at low and high density. Factorial experimental treatments comprising two plant densities (P1 = 60,000 and P2 = 100,000 plants ha -1) and three nitrogen rates (N1 = 60, N2 = 120 and N3 = 180 kg N ha -1) were kept in main plots, while six split application for N in different proportions were kept in subplots at different growth stages of maize in two equal (S1), three equal (S2), three unequal (S3), four equal (S4), five equal (S5) and five unequal splits (S6) at sowing and with 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th irrigation at two weeks intervals.

Its origin is probably in Arabia, but the Indus Valley has also been suggested as one of its centers of origin. It was being grown in Sindh and the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) since a very long time. The Lucknow Horticultural Gardens played a key role in the introduction of the date palm to the rest of India. Subsequently it spread to the west coast of India up to north of Bombay (now Mumbai) where it was tapped for neera and toddy as well as other uses. A tree so ancient cannot be without considerable folklore attached to it. Plenty of medicinal uses are also mentioned. The palm can grow under very low rainfall conditions and even in slightly saline soils, making it an ideal tree for development at oases in the deserts and other dry areas. The Bedouin tribes of the Arabian desert are known to survive and thrive on just dates, flat-bread, and camel's milk. Date production peaked in 1996 according to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAQ). There are over 600 varieties of date palm throughout the world. Some of the best dates were reputed to be grown around the city of Basra in Iraq from where they were shipped to India in dhows (sailing vessels) wrapped in mats made from date palm leaves.

This study aimed to understand the relationship between market proximity, NTFP dependence and forest condition, and assess how it is mediated by local forest institutions. Three villages with different degrees of access to markets for sale of forest products, in an area of high poverty and forest dependence in the dry tropical forest belt in central India, were examined. The village with the greatest access to the market had a greater proportion of income coming from non-forest sources, the least dependence on NTFP harvest and the most degraded forests. The strongest forest institution was found in the village closest to the market, owing largely to its access to support from the Forest Department. This emphasizes the extreme vulnerability of forest villages located distant from local markets, which are forced to depend on forests for most of their livelihood and income requirements, and left to deal with degrading forests in the absence of technical and financial support from the Forest Department. There is a critical need to strengthen local institutions for sustainable forest management in such villages, and to provide them with alternate sources of income generation. © 2009 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Biodiversity; Forest dependence; India; Joint forest management; Local institutions; Maharashtra; Non-timber forest products","Forest dependence; India; Joint forest management; Local institutions; Maharashtra; Non-timber forest products; Biodiversity; Commerce; Societies and institutions; Timber; Forestry; dry forest; forest management; forest product; household income; market development; market system; rural area; sustainable forestry; tropical forest; Biodiversity; Commerce; Forest Management; Forests; India; Sales; Sustainable Forest Management; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia","Ghate, R.; SHODH, 50 Kinkhede Layout, Bharat Nagar, Nagpur 440033, Maharashtra, India; email: ruchaghate@gmail.com",,,03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

The area is highly degraded and thus demands urgent attention to recover and sustain depleted fisheries; restore degraded habitats; and reduce land and ship-based pollutions. Achieving this goal would be a mirage if the actual value of the ecosystem's contribution to the society is not known. Valuation can help identify the main beneficiaries of conservation and the magnitude of benefits they receive, and help design measures to capture some of these benefits and contribute to financing of conservation. Hence this study used the direct output approach to estimate the value of relevant marine activities in the area. The result shows that the total value of output in GCLME when some outputs namely, marine fishery, offshore oil production, NTFP (periwinkle) and mining, are considered as $49,941.4 million. Among these uses, offshore oil production has the highest value accounting for 59.79% of the total estimate. These estimates provides sufficient evidence to show that GCLME provide enormous value and should be managed appropriately to sustain the gains if the economic development would be guaranteed especially considering that most countries in the GCLM depend on natural resources for their survival.

For example, efforts in the past to support cultivation of NWFP in southern Nigeria under a USAID funded Cross River State forestry project, especially through nursery establishment for some rural communities, was not sustained as the initiative was abandoned by the participants. Hence to promote cultivation of NWFP, this study ascertained socioeconomic factors that influence cultivation of NWFPs. Multi stage sampling technique was used in selection of respondents (households) from two States: Cross River and Enugu States of southern Nigeria. A sample size of 400 households was used for the study. Probit and multinomial logistic regressions were used in estimating NWFP cultivation. The findings show that cultivation of NWFP was positively determined by gender, farming occupation (especially of women farmers) distance to forests where NWFP was collected, proportion of household food from NWFP, and medium wealth category. Age had a negative effect on cultivation until the age of 46 after which the effect became positive. In addition, household size, gender and farming occupation of household heads positively influenced cultivation of NWFP in plantations as against home gardens while gender and farming occupation had positive effect on cultivation of some stands of NWFP as against home gardens. Incorporating the findings of this study in future intervention project for NWFP cultivation will help sustain the initiative. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cultivation; Non-wood forest products; Socioeconomic determinants","biodiversity; cultivation; home garden; household survey; natural resource; nontimber forest product; regression analysis; rural population; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; Africa; Nigeria; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa","Chukwuone, N.

Methods: All ophthalmologists in district headquarter hospitals in NWFP and agency headquarter hospitals in FATA were requested to participate in a surveillance programme for the detection of blinding xerophthalmia (corneal xerosis, corneal ulcers, keratomalacia and corneal scars related to vitamin A deficiency) for children aged 0-72 months. The surveillance included reporting of each case of blinding xerophthalmia presenting to the participating eye units over a period of 12 months and recording their socio-economic and other related characteristics. Results: Seventy six cases of blinding xerophthalmia were reported and there was almost no gender difference. Children came from 19 of 31 districts and agencies in NWFP and FATA with a working ophthalmologist. The commonest age at presentation was 25-48 months and almost half of them belonged to households with a monthly income of < Pak Rs. 1200 (US $ < 20). Precipitating systemic illnesses were diarrhea and fever with cough in 63.2% and 56.6% cases, respectively. Almost a third of children aged > 9 months had not been immunized against measles. A quarter of all children had not been adequately breast-fed, and 7 children (9%) had never been breastfed. Majority of the cases presented during summer and autumn months. Conclusions: Our surveillance data provide evidence that blinding xerophthalmia does occur in children in NWFP and its adjoining FATA. The surveillance system identified high risk age groups, systemic illnesses, seasons and community groups. The detection system detects minimal numbers of cases and it is likely that the problem is even more severe.

A relatively moist, Mediterranean climate, natural woodlands of evergreen, sclerophyllous oaks and planted forests of Mediterranean pines and cypresses characterize the vast majority of forestlands in northern Israel. In contrast, an eastern semi-arid pocket associated with the Syrian-African Rift Valley presents challenging environmental conditions for afforestation efforts as practiced by the British Mandatory Forest Department, the Israeli Governmental Forest Department, the Keren Kayemeth Leisrael (KKL) and private entrepreneurs over the past 80 years. The accumulated experiences of planting new forests in this semi-arid zone, combined with results from introduction plots and afforestation areas throughout Israel, led to the development of a unique set of silvicultural tools and tree species employed to guarantee successful afforestation plans. All of these new afforestations function as multipurpose forestry systems offering landscape, watershed, soil conservation, pasture, recreational and NWFP goods and services and can provide a relevant model of sustainable forest management for semi-arid and arid zones worldwide. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Apart from communal hill slopes, agricultural land is divided into 3 categories: damani (rainfed), jewardara (irrigated but with no rice), and shoulgarey (irrigated, mainly used for rice). The people permanently own the rainfed land, while the irrigated land is under a tenure system known as garzinda wesh (circulatory tenure), with 10 years' tenure rotation allotted through khasanray (drawing lot). This type of land tenure system also exists partially in other villages of Upper Malakand such as Jolagaram, Khar, and Totakan. This system was introduced in the 16th century with the idea of sharing all types of land-including irrigated land, fertile land, slope land, etc-in equal shares and with the aim of enabling the landowner tribe to respond collectively if some other tribe or majority tenants tried to seize any portion of land. Due to social conflicts, this system can have negative impacts today, especially in the form of soil erosion leading to land degradation. We highlight the positive and negative environmental impacts of the system. To this purpose, a detailed survey was conducted using focus group interviews, participatory rural appraisals, mapping, and transit walks with timelines. The results show how social response to the suitability of the system for livelihoods and social integrity can vary. The impact on fuelwood consumption is negative, leading to deforestation and lack of soil conservation. Abolishment of garzinda wesh in the village is recommended. © 2009 by the authors.","Circulatory land tenure; Malakand district; North West Frontier Province (NWFP); Pakistan; Soil conservation; Swat districts","deforestation; ecological impact; hillslope; land tenure; landowner; social conflict; social impact; soil conservation; soil erosion; tenure system; Malakand; North West Frontier; Pakistan; Swat Valley","Nafees, M.; Department of Environmental Sciences, , NWFP 25120, Pakistan; email: nafees36@yahoo.com",,,02764741,,,,"English","Mt.

These non-timber forest products (NTFP) include fuelwood, food and fruits, seeds, fodder, rattan, bamboo, vines, ornamental plants, medicinal plants, and wildlife. Since some of these products are not being sold in the market but are locally consumed by gatherers, there are no available market prices. In cases where market prices of a particular NTFP were not available, shadow prices were used. Forest products benefits for MFR are estimated to be P386 per hectare per year, with wildlife products making up the highest proportion (31 percent), followed by fodder (27 percent), then ornamental plants (17 percent) and seeds and planting materials (14 percent). Other products that have low percentage values of the total NTFP are bamboo (4 percent), fuelwood (3 percent), vines (2 percent), and rattan (0.4 percent). The income derived by a household from NTFP in MFR is about P1,490 per year, representing only about three percent of the total annual household income of MFR farmers.

Many indigenous people depend upon non-Timber forest products (NTFP) and crops for a range of goods including food, medicine, fi bre and construction materials. However, the dependency of these products on biotic pollination services is poorly understood. We used the biologically and culturally diverse Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in India to characterise the types of NTFP and crop products of 213 plant species and asses their degree of dependency on animal pollination. We found that 80 per cent of all species benefi ted from animal pollination in their reproduction, and that 62 per cent of crop products and 40 per cent of NTFP benefi ted from biotic pollination in their production. Further we identifi ed the likely pollinating taxa documented as responsible for the production of these products, mainly bees and other insects. A lower proportion of indigenous plant products (39 per cent) benefi ted from biotic pollination than products from introduced plants (61 per cent).

It is designed to protect rubber tapper communities, their forests, and their livelihoods while preventing deforestation and conserving biodiversity. In response to changing markets and policies, rubber tappers in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve have recently diversified production to include market agriculture and cattle production, precipitating deforestation in the reserve, with the implication of increased ecological degradation compared to the extraction of nontimber forest products (NTFPs). Our remote sensing and forest inventory analyses yield different insights about the environmental consequences of distinct land-use mixes in two extractive communities, one of which emphasizes cattle and the other, NTFPs. Remote sensing results show a predictably greater impact on forest cover in the cattle-oriented community. This preliminary study is based on nested household- and community-level forest inventory and biodiversity analyses in two communities. Surprisingly, we found higher tree biodiversity in the rubber trail forests of the cattle-oriented community, and significantly lower tree species richness, tree density, total basal area, and number of trees of commercial size in the same land-use unit in the NTFP-focused community. Land-use surveys indicate lower levels of game consumption and hunting in the cattle-oriented community, and strong support for the development of sustainable timber extraction in both communities. The distinct type and degree of forest impact in the two communities exposes the problem of single-impact assessment as the sole means of performance and categorical land-use prohibitions as an effective mode of regulation in conservation areas. © 2009 by the author(s).","Biodiversity; Ecological monitoring; Extractive reserves; Land use; Livelihood; Tropical deforestation","biodiversity; biomonitoring; cattle; deforestation; environmental degradation; forest cover; forest inventory; land use; remote sensing; rubber; sustainable development; Brazil; Bos","Vadjunec, J.

The effect of 10 h continuous commercial kebab frying on the physiochemical parameters of the tallow was studied and evaluated. The tallow was evaluated for ash%, Peroxide Value, Optical Density, Conjugated Dienes, Conjugatet Ttrienes, %FFA, Acid Value and Anisidine Value after 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 h of frying and the effect of frying kebab resulted in the increase of all these parameters. Results of the linear regression model suggest that frying kebabs have significant correlation with the oxidation of tallow and continuous frying for more than 10 h is not recommended. It is also concluded that kebab frying accelerate the thermal oxidation of the tallow. The results obtained in this experiment propose that POV can be adopted as the standard factor in the evaluation of oxidation of tallow used for the frying kebab and the upper limit will be determined as 28 meqlkg. © Asian Network for Scientific Information. 2009.","Anisidine value; Free fatty acids; Frying; Kebab; Optical density; Tallow","fatty acid; Article; commercial phenomena; correlation analysis; food biotechnology; frying; hydrolysis; kebab frying; nonhuman; optical density; oxidation; physical chemistry; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; vapor pressure",,,"Asian Network for Scientific Information",16805194,,,,"English","Pak.

The number of trees per treatment was 10 and 15 in the first and second seasons, respectively. A highly significant difference between tapping direction (P≤ 0.001) was obtained in all pickings except the third picking in the first season and the first picking in the second season. The gum yield increased by 60% when the tapping was on the eastern and western sides towards direct sun light. The combined analysis showed significant differences (P≤ 0.05 and P≤ 0.001) on total gum yield (g/tree) and the number of trees yielding gum.

During 1998-2004, we conducted an annual survey of households in the two villages, Baka and Daka, which represent different stages in the shift from a subsistence agroecosystem to a rubber plantation-dominated system in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. Significant negative correlations were observed between gross income and dependence on NTFPs-generated income in both Baka and Daka villages (P = 0.029 in Baka and P = 0.028 in Daka), which is supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy households. When the rubber price dropped during 1998-2001, the NTFPs income of Baka increased greatly from US$59.10 to US$145 per household, or from 6.4% to 26.6% of household gross income. In contrast, in Daka village, NTFPs income increased by insignificant amounts of US$1.6 per household in 1998 to US$23.8 in 2001, but this was compensated by an increase in income from off-farm work of US$11 to US$147 (an increase from 1.8% to 16.2% of gross income per household) from 1998 to 2001 in Daka. NTFPs retained important roles both in alleviating risk associated with monoculture price fluctuations and in generating income for relatively poor people.

This study also compared the incidence of aphakic retinal detachment in intracapsular versus extracapsular cataract extraction as well as the duration between cataract surgery and retinal detachment. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A total of 50 patients were recruited in this prospective study. A Proforma was specially designed for this purpose. Detailed history with reference to age, sex, presenting complaints, spectacle wear, previous ocular surgery, duration of surgery/laser treatment, systemic and family history was taken. All patients had detailed ophthalmic examination, underwent conventional retinal reattachment surgery, and were followed up for 6 months. RESULTS: Of the total number studied, 86% of the patients were males; only 14% were females, with a mean age of 58 years. The overall anatomical success was achieved in 40 (80%) eyes. The visual acuity of 6/12 and better was achieved in 8 (16%) eyes. 20 (40%) eyes attained a vision of 6/18 to 6/36. 12 (24%) eyes had a vision between 6/60 to CF 3m. The vision could not be improved beyond CF 3m in 10 (20%) eyes. CONCLUSION: Vitreous loss during cataract surgery is the most common cause of aphakic retinal detachment. The risk is maximal in the first and second year. The overall anatomical attachment achieved through conventional retinal detachment surgery is 80%.",,"adult; aged; aphakia; article; cataract extraction; female; follow up; human; incidence; male; middle aged; Pakistan; postoperative complication; prospective study; retina detachment; treatment outcome; vitreous body detachment; Adult; Aged; Aphakia, Postcataract; Cataract Extraction; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Retinal Detachment; Treatment Outcome; Vitreous Detachment","Zaman, M.",,,11152613,,,"20120642","English","Niger J Med",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949501280

Many organochlorine pesticides including p,p′-DDT are long lasting due to their non-degradability can travel to distant places and being fat soluble can accumulate in animals and human bodies. Due to the persistent nature of p,p′-DDT, its adverse environmental and health impacts, the present study was undertaken to examine the residual p,p′-DDT in and around abandoned p,p′-DDT manufacturing factory in Amman Gharh, Nowshera, NWFP. Samples of soil, sediments and water were collected in and around the factory area, nearby p,p′-DDT stores, main factory drain leading to river Kabul and nearby villages. Standard procedures were used for the collection, transportation and storage of samples for analyses. Extraction of each sample for p,p′-DDT analyses was carried out in triplicates using Soxhelt extraction. p,p′-DDT contents in the samples were analyzed by capillary GC with electron capture detector. Most of the samples collected up to half kilometer distance from the site of the DDT factory were found contaminated.

It will emerge as a potential public health burden faced by the developing countries in the near future. In children, Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is mainly associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome and is therefore considered as a metabolic complication of obesity. NAFLD comprises of a range of chronic liver diseases from simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis with liver failure. Since the prevalence of obesity in children is increasing, the prevalence of NAFLD in children is expected to increase as well. Prevention of obesity and identification of children with an increased risk of NAFLD are important steps in preventing irreversible liver damage. This prospective study was carried out in the primary schools of Dera Ismail Khan History City having mixed population. Clinical examination of the children excluded those suffering from chronic health ailments. History from the parents excluded the intake of hepatotoxic drugs. Body mass status of child was determined according to World Health Organization s' criteria and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s gender and age specific growth charts. Randomly selected normal weight and obese children have undergone abdominal ultrasound examination to confirm or rule out hepatic steatosis (Fatty Liver) by detecting the alteration in ultrasound/hyperechogenicity of the organ. Randomly selected children (normal weight and obese) among the 1336 school going children were subjected to ultrasound examination, comprising of 55 boys (59.13%) and 38 (40.86%) girls. 67 (72.04%) were obese and 26 (27.95) as normal weights.

Malarial parasites were identified in the blood slides of suspected patients of the disease from July, 2004 to June, 2006 and encompassed 7748 subjects. Out of 7748 suspected cases of malaria, 3240 (41.8%) were found to be positive for malarial parasite in blood smear slides. Out of positive cases, 1681 (51.8%) were identified as Plasmodium vivax infection and 1559 (48.1%) cases with P. falciparum. However, seasonal variation was also noted with the highest (85.4%: 141/165) infection of P. vivax in March and lowest (18.6%: 59/316) in October while infection of P. falciparum was highest (81.3%: 257/316) in October and lowest (14.5%: 24/165) in March. Infection with P. vivax in male was 75.7% (125/165) in March and in female 26.3% (58/220) in May whereas infection of P. falciparum in male was 61.5% (245/398) in July and in female was 20.5% (65/316) in October. These results are compared with those of other studies done in Pakistan. Cases of P. malariae and P. ovale were not found in the present study.

Management traditions were further improved after Independence, with the emphasis remaining on sustained timber production from state forest reserves. In the mid-1970s under the National Commission on Agriculture, a paradigm shift took place from low-investment, slow-growing forestry to high-investment, fastgrowing forestry. The National Forest Policy 1988 introduced participatory forest management, helping decelerate forest loss, but not stopping it completely. In recent times, two trends are clear: 1) wood production from agro-forestry is significantly higher than from state forests; and 2) non-timber forest products have become more important than timber. These trends would support the Planning Commission of India's (2000-2020) strategy of faster, more inclusive growth. Opportunities, however, need to be carefully embedded within the government forest management system through appropriate policy and institutional adaptations and through increased knowledge and information support to local communities.","Agroforestry; Forest history; Forest policy analysis; India; NTFP management","agroforestry; conference proceeding; forest management; forestry policy; forestry practice; forestry production; future prospect; governance approach; institutional framework; nontimber forest product; paradigm shift; participatory approach; trend analysis; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia","Singh, K.D.; Academy of Forests and Environmental Sciencesemail: karndeo_singh@hotmail.com",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Enhanced emergence and establishment of the mung bean crop are considered to be the most important factors contributing to the crop yield. Mung bean cultivars (NM-92 and NM-98) seed were primed for 6 and 12 hours in different solution of water and osmotic solution (ψ0) of polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) equivalent to 0, -0.2, -0.5 and -1.1 MPa (Mega Pascal). The primed seed along with control (un-primed) were sown in field experiments at the Research Farm of NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar during 2003 and 2004. Delayed phenological observations were recorded in NM-98 compared to NM-92, but no differences in yield and yield components were observed for both cultivars of mung bean except grains pod-1 being higher for NM-98. Primed seed performed better when compared to control, and resulted in 12 % more grain yield. A decrease in osmotic potential in treatment solution from 0 to -1.1 MPa resulted in better performance, in terms of yield and yield components, but was not consistent. Significant interaction of Varieties x Duration x PEG Treatment for days to emergence, grain and biological yield suggest the differential response of each treatment levels over the other.

This paper examines and reviews some of the work that has been done in the Miombo ecoregion on the ecology, utilisation and management of the Miombo woodlands. The review points to the richness of the Miombo regions' plant species, with an estimated 8 500 species of higher plants, of which over 54% are endemic. The review also highlights the response of the Miombo ecosystem to fire and other anthropogenic processes and the lack of wide-scale adoption or implementation of the major research findings. The review shows that there is a wide range of NTFPs that significantly contribute to the total household income in forest areas and to the national economies through provision of opportunities for small-scale trade especially in the rural areas. However, there is a concern that commercialisation usually results in overexploitation of the resource by the outsiders who become the major players. It is suggested from the review that the lack of capacity by national institutions to manage Miombo woodland resources could be addressed by using participatory approaches to natural resource management. It is also proposed that for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in the Miombo region, research should focus on issues that specifically address NTFPs. In order to facilitate commercialisation and benefit the economically weak, policies that incorporate postharvesting technical assistance and access to information on markets, technology and microcredit should be developed and promoted.

Among 4709 positive isolates, 314 (6.67%) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest rate of infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa was observed in orthopedic ward (24.61%) and OPD (20%), in other wards the infection was between 13% to 1.5%. Gender-wise prevalence showed 61.78% male and 38.22% females were infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The highest percentage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were observed in pus (57.64 %) and urine (24.2 %) samples. Maximum Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were found between March to August and the highest percentage 13.846% was observed in June. Using the disc diffusion method, the resistance patterns of 314 isolates against 14 antimicrobial agents were determined. The highest resistance was observed against ampicillin (≥ 98.4%), ampicillin/ sulbactam (85.3%), co-amoxiclave (83.8%) and ofloxacin (68.4%) and least resistance was observed against amikacin (24%). Similarly the MIC for ampicillin (4 to >2048 μg/ml), ampicillin/sulbactam (1 to 2048 μg/ml) and co-amoxiclave (1 to >2048 μg/ml) against clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also high. High resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa against various commonly used antibiotics showed the alarming situation. The control of drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa required rational prescribing and proper use of antibiotics.","Antibiotics; MIC; Nosocomial infections; Prevalence; Pseudomonas aeruginosa","amikacin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; azteronam; ceftazidime; enoxacin; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; ofloxacin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; sparfloxacin; sultamicillin; tobramycin; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; article; bacterial growth; bacterium isolate; controlled study; disk diffusion; female; gender; human; male; minimum inhibitory concentration; orthopedics; prevalence; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas infection; pus; urine; ward; cross infection; drug effect; Gram negative infection; growth, development and aging; hospital; hospital patient; isolation and purification; microbiological examination; microbiology; multidrug resistance; prospective study; season; suppuration; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cross Infection; Disk Diffusion Antimicrobial Tests; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Pseudomonas Infections; Seasons; Suppuration; Urine","Iqbal, Z.; Department of Pharmacy, Pakistan; email: zafar_iqbal@upesh.edu.pk",,,1011601X,,,"18614431","English","Pak.

Understory composition and structure is important for ecosystem functioning, while also having social and economic value through the harvest of certain herb and shrub species. The potential for co-management of young and mature, managed and unmanaged stands for timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was assessed in two separate replicated experiments. Experiment A examined pole-sized lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands that had been pre-commercially thinned (PCT) to target densities of 250, 500, 1000, and 2000 stems/ha. Half of each of these four thinning units was repeatedly fertilized, resulting in eight experimental units. Experiment B examined six different stand types: young plantations, pole-sized lodgepole pine stands either PCT, PCT plus repeated fertilization, or unthinned, mature, and old growth. Fifty-four herb and shrub species were identified as potential NTFPs, with the responses of individual species, as well as mean total herb, shrub, berry-producing and overall total NTFPs being assessed. In Experiment A, mean total abundance (crown volume index) of NTFPs, as well as mean total herb NTFPs were significantly greater in fertilized than in unfertilized stands. Thinning treatments did not significantly affect NTFP volume, however, fertilization treatments produced five significant responses by individual species (Achillea millefolium, Epilobium angustifolium, Taraxacum officinale, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Rubus idaeus). In Experiment B, four of the six species responses that were significant had greater abundance in young, managed stands (young plantation, thinned, or thinned-fertilized) than in the unmanaged stands. Mean total NTFP volume and mean total herb NTFP volume also followed this pattern. A. uva-ursi, E. angustifolium, Lonicera involucrata, Sorbus sitchensis and Thalictrum occidentale all had significantly higher abundance in young, managed stands than in all other treatments. Results suggest that co-management for timber and NTFPs is possible in this ecosystem, with further research needed to evaluate livelihood values of these crops. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP) of 1994 initiated a significant reduction in the harvesting of older forests on federal land. We used historical satellite imagery to assess the effect of this reduction in relation to: past harvest rates, management of non-federal forests, and the growing role of fire. Harvest rates in non-federal large-diameter forests (LDF) either decreased or remained stable at relatively high rates following the NWFP, meaning that harvest reductions on federal forests, which cover half of the region, resulted in a significant regional drop in the loss of LDF to harvest. However, increased losses of LDF to fire outweighed reductions in LDF harvest across large areas of the region. Elevated fire levels in the western United States have been correlated to changing climatic conditions, and if recent fire patterns persist, preservation of older forests in dry ecosystems will depend upon practical and coordinated fire management across the landscape. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Disturbance; Fire; Forest management; Landsat; Northwest Forest Plan; Old growth","climate conditions; environmental disturbance; fire management; forest dynamics; forest fire; forest management; harvesting; Landsat; old-growth forest; satellite imagery; North America; Pacific Northwest","Healey, S.

The açaí berry (Euterpe oleracea) is a native palm found in forest ecosystems of northern Brazil and historically extracted and sold in regional markets. Recent increases in national and international açaí demand have resulted in dramatic price increases. Management decisions on a local producer level reflect trends not typically associated with traditional NTFPs as future production and income expectations increase. This case study draws on research conducted in peri-urban communities in close proximity to Belém, Brazil. The work draws links between recent açaí intensification trends in upland areas and information pathways that are contributing to this pattern. This paper argues that external information sources regarding land use choices are prioritized over local knowledge and market indicators which previously have been described as drivers for intensification processes of NTFPs. This qualitative analysis highlights the power structures that influence information sharing and in turn, land use choices on a community level. The results of this analysis are important for NTFP intervention initiatives focused on risk management for smallholders.

The model contrasts patterns of spatial use, resource health, and income generation under open access and community-managed institutions. We then test the conceptual model by investigating the case of xate production in the rainforest of Chiapas, Mexico, using survey work conducted over two separate periods.

First assuming that economic activity is cultural, we use the concept of pluriform economy to disaggregate NTFP activity, while the concept of cultural keystone products is used to arrange the component products into salient groups. One keystone product emerged-balsam boughs-and two keystone groupings-game and furs. Balsam, game, and furs represented 34% of all NTFP identified, yet accounted for the activities of 71% of the sample. The concepts facilitated organization of NTFP into meaningful analytical units. We suggest that balsam harvesters are distinct, overlapping groups organized by culturally important NTFP. We conclude that the cultural keystone concept will contribute to research by providing indicators of distinct, interconnected social institutions.","Balsam fir; Cultural economy; Cultural keystone species; Minnesota; NTFP","cultural tradition; economic activity; forestry production; harvesting; nontimber forest product; Minnesota; North America; United States; Abies balsamea","Wilsey, D.S.; University of Minnesota Extention, Cloquet, MN, United States",,,08941920,,,,"English","Soc.

These included three new alleles, namely Glu-B1e, Glu-B1h and Glu-D1n, which had not previously been found in landraces of Pakistani wheat. Furthermore, Glu-D1m and Glu-D1n, which are considered to be endemic alleles in Pakistan and Afghanistan, were both detected from Balochistan. Twenty genotypes were identified based on combinations of alleles at the three Glu-1 loci.

The study reveals that the community benefited immensely from the JFM programme in terms of employment in forest activities and income obtained from the collection of non-timber forest produce (NTFP), which helped the community to overcome the distress of poverty. Forest growth has been excellent due to strong community protection. On the institutional front, the study assessed the Strengths and weaknesses of the interactions between the community and the Forest Department (FD) through elaborate discussions with the members of a forest protection committee (FPC). The FD has failed to provide appropriate technical know-how to carry out forest management activities and legal support to resolve conflicts (customary rights problems) with neighbouring villages, and ignored traditional knowledge of the community in forest management. Despite this, the community's keen interest in the regeneration and protection of the forests can be attributed to the inherent attitudes they possess towards the forest.",,"assessment method; environmental protection; forest management; institutional framework; local participation; poverty alleviation; traditional knowledge; village; Andhra Pradesh; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia","Behera, B.; Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, , Kharagpur-721302, India",,,09703357,,,,"English","J.

None of the isolates produced aflatoxin except the AP4 isolate. The positive control in all the batches of A. flavus and A. parasiticus isolates produced maximum aflatoxin in grains at 16% moisture and 25°C temperature in a laboratory experiment of this study. The accuracy of cultural tests ELIZA assessed by percent recovery of the toxin from positive controls, spiked samples and spiked controls ranged from 98-100%. An assay based on multiplex PCR was applied for the detection of four genes located at different loci coding enzymes in the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway of A. flavus and A. parasiticus strains. These are AflR, reported as regulatory gene and functions as a transcription activator, others are structural genes named according to their substrates Nor 1 (norsolorinic acid), Ver 1(Versicolorin) and Omt (O methylosterigmatocystin). Recovery of these four genes in the DNA template of known Aflatoxinogenic A. flavus strains in every experimental trial of present study as a positive control showed the accurate PCR experimentation. None of the A. flavus and 35 A. parasiticus (AP1-AP3 and AP5-AP36) isolates produced aflatoxin in both the flask and storage experiments. Similarly all these strains did not exhibit presence of all the four genes in the PCRs of the extracted DNA at one time.

In both localities, timber is harvested via reduced-impact logging (RIL) practices. In Guatemala, the main NTFP extracted is foliage from the understory xate palm (Chamaedorea spp.); in northern Bolivia, the fruits of the Brazil nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa). The Guatemalan case suggests a relatively high degree of compatibility due to low timber harvesting intensities, coupled with temporal, spatial, and social segregation of xate extraction in a well-defined land tenure system. In northern Bolivia, forest management regulations pay little attention to NTFPs and land tenure issues and related conflict complicate efforts to limit timber harvesting impacts on Brazil nut trees. The introduction of timber management plans overlain on customary property rights systems in which the extraction of Brazil nut is organized could undercut its management system. The two case studies suggest that specific legislative, education, and project interventions may help to promote the compatibility of timber and NTFP extraction and management. These include formal training of foresters on NTFP ecology and management while taking into account the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the design of management plans. Tropical forest users, research managers, and policy makers will also better understand the need for integrated management of timber and NTFPs, if the trade-offs and potential economic benefits from NTFP extraction are clarified. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of harvest on leaf production, growth and fecundity of wild individual palm trees has been studied, but little is known about palm harvest in agro-forestry systems. In the Maya area of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, leaves of the xa'an palm (Sabal yapa, and Sabal mexicana) have been used since pre-Hispanic days for thatching the roofs of traditional Maya houses. The Maya have introduced xa'an palms in homegardens and the care they provide them improves their growth. Maya householders agree on what they consider to be the best harvest intensity for xa'an, recommending one or two harvest events per year, and leaving one or two leaves in each event; however, there is not ecological information documenting whether the traditional harvesting practices are the most adequate to maintain or increase leaf production, and their effect on the growth and fecundity of the palm trees. In Maxcanú, Yucatán, we studied eight family homegardens with S. yapa and S. mexicana. The selected individuals from each homegarden (n = 252) underwent six harvest treatments for 2 years C: control, no harvest, Al: annual harvest, leaving three leaves on the palm, Am: annual harvest leaving two leaves, Ah: annual harvest leaving one leaf, Sl: two harvests per year leaving three leaves, Sm: two harvests per year leaving two leaves. Treatments Ah and Sm simulated the traditional harvest method, and the remaining treatments simulated higher or lower harvest intensities and frequencies. Leaf production was higher in individual palms under higher harvest intensities and frequencies (Ah, Sl and Sm), but palm growth and leaf size were not affected by harvest. Number of inflorescences per palm differed between treatments and between homegardens during the first year only, but we could not find a clear pattern of variation. Production of new leaves was affected by initial palm size and initial leaf number. Removing mature leaves while leaving the young ones, as well as the intensity and frequency, with which traditional harvest is practiced, stimulate palms to compensate the defoliation effects by producing new leaves. This practice is based on empirical Maya knowledge that enables the manipulation of micro-environmental conditions and the development of sustainable harvesting strategies for the xa'an palm in traditional agro-forestry systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Br.) and avellano (Gevuina avellana Mol.), collected by indigenous women in southern Chile. Trees producing commercial-quality leaves grew in secondary forests dominated by species usually abundant in ecological formations that follow forest degradation. Natural availability of greenery was relatively low (658 and 38 commercial leaves per hectare for romerillo and avellano, respectively) which added to restrictive market conditions resulted in modest financial returns and a contribution to household income of less than 1%. Our results confirm that trade on NTFP does not always lead to significant income generation.

Multiple-species approaches, particular those which employ site-occupancy estimation, have been proposed as robust and efficient alternatives for assessing the status of wildlife populations over large spatial scales, but implemented examples are few. I used bats as a model to evaluate design considerations for the use of occupancy estimation to assess population status and habitat associations for eight species of bats covered under a regional conservation plan. Bats were one of the groups expected to benefit from a system of reserves for species associated with late-successional/old-growth (LSOG) habitat designated under the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP). This study produced the first estimates for probabilities of occupancy and detection for bats at a regional scale. Overall probabilities of occupancy ranged from 0.586 to 0.783 and probabilities of detection ranged from 0.239 to 0.532 among the eight species modeled. Although point estimates of occupancy suggested association with NWFP habitat categories for some species, estimate precision was low. Models that assumed constant occupancy with respect to reserve- and LSOG-status were supported for most species. I used model-averaged estimates of occupancy and detection for each species to estimate survey effort necessary to meet precision targets. Occupancy estimation was best suited to species with the highest detection probabilities. Species that are rare or difficult to detect will require enhancement in survey methods or more intensive survey effort to produce meaningful estimates. Optimizing monitoring efforts to address multiple species requires tradeoffs among survey methods, levels of effort, and acceptable levels of precision.","Detection probability; Habitat conservation plan; Monitoring; Northwest forest plan; Site-occupancy; Survey effort","bat; biodiversity; conservation planning; environmental modeling; habitat conservation; population estimation; regional planning; species conservation; wildlife management; North America; Pacific Northwest","Weller, T.J.; Pacific Southwest Research Station, 1700 Bayview Drive, Arcata, CA 95521, United States; email: tweller@fs.fed.us",,,00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

Low birthweight is a widely used indicator of newborn health. This study investigates the association of birthweight <2.5 kg (LBW) with a wide range of factors related to geo-demographics, maternal health and pregnancy history in public hospitals at Peshawar, North West Frontier Province (NWFP) Pakistan. It is noted that that Low birthweight may arise for two different reasons, one related to gestational age and the other corresponding to births that are small for gestational age (SGA). Methods. Data on geo-demographics, maternal health indicators, pregnancy history and outcome scores for newborn babies and their families (n = 1039) were collected prospectively between August and November 2003 in a cross-sectional survey of four public hospitals in Peshawar, NWFP-Pakistan. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were used to investigate the factors affecting incidence of LBW, by multivariate logistic regression. Gestational age was included as an explanatory variable therefore the additional covariates identified by model selection are expected to account for SGA. Results. The main geo-demographic risk factors for SGA identified in this study, controlling for gestational age of less than 37 weeks, are maternal age, nationality and consanguinity. Presentation with anaemia and the history of previous abortion/miscarriage were also found to be significant independent factors. The adjusted odds ratio for gestational age showed the largest effect in explaining the incidence of LBW. The next highest odds ratio was for maternal age below 20 years. The explanatory model included two pairwise interactions, for which the predicted incidence figures for LBW show an increase among the Tribal area with presentation of anaemia, and among full term babies with their mothers having a previous history of abortion/miscarriage. Conclusion. In addition to gestational age, specific factors related to geo-demographics (maternal age, consanguinity and nationality), maternal health (anaemia) and pregnancy history (abortion/miscarriage) were significantly associated with the incidence of LBW observed at the four hospitals surveyed in Peshawar. These results indicate that cultural factors can adversely affect the incidence of SGA in this area of Pakistan. © 2008 Badshah et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"abortion; adult; anamnesis; anemia; article; consanguinity; demography; ethnicity; female; gestational age; health survey; human; incidence; low birth weight; major clinical study; maternal age; maternal welfare; multivariate analysis; newborn; outcome assessment; Pakistan; public hospital; risk factor; social status; spontaneous abortion; birth weight; comparative study; low birth weight; Pakistan; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prevalence; prospective study; questionnaire; risk factor; small for date infant; socioeconomics; spontaneous abortion; statistical model; Abortion, Spontaneous; Adult; Birth Weight; Female; Gestational Age; Health Status Indicators; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Logistic Models; Multivariate Analysis; Pakistan; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors","Badshah, S.; Deprtment of Statistics, Pakistan; email: Sareerbadshah@yahoo.com",,,14712458,,,"18533023","English","BMC Public Health",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849152128

We conducted a survey among 786 households in 31 agricultural villages adjoining the eastern boundary of the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, in the southern Western Ghats to see whether household wealth, social status, literacy and distance to the forest boundary influenced resource harvesting. Fuel-wood, fodder and green leaves were the major products harvested in this agricultural region. The effect of distance from the reserve boundary differed with the product harvested and its use value. Distance was a constraint for households that harvested for domestic consumption, whereas it was not significant for households that harvested for earnings. Wealth was independent of resource interest in the forest, except for the poorer lower caste households with lower levels of literacy that sold fuel-wood to earn a living. Wealthier households harvested green leaves for fertilizing their fields, and fodder harvest was related to livestock ownership. The lower cost of forest products compared to commercially available substitutes probably fuelled extraction. Forest products contributed disproportionately to household consumption as compared with household earnings. Discouraging the harvest of forest products within protected areas might be the only viable conservation strategy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The current study estimated seroprevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and evaluated associated factors among volunteer blood donors of the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan. Of 1,131 volunteer blood donors enrolled, 46 (4.1%) were positive for anti-HCV antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that positive donors were more likely to be 27-32 years old or 32 years old, have had 1-2 injections or 2 injections in the past year, or 1-5 intravenous (IV) drips or 5 I/V drips in the past 5 years. Positive donors had a family history of jaundice and were more likely to have been shaved (facial and armpit) by barbers. There was high prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies among blood donors of the NWFP. Public awareness programs should target the identified risk factors to prevent HCV transmission.

The fungal species were presumed rare, associated with late-successional old-growth forests, and in need of protection not afforded by the major elements of the NWFP, including a vast system of forest reserves. The SMP guidelines thus called for protecting known sites while gathering information through surveys to learn more about species rarity, distribution, habitat requirements, and persistence concerns. If new information revealed that a species was not rare, not associated with late-successional old-growth forests, or that other aspects of the NWFP guidelines provided for their persistence (e.g. adequate protection provided by forest reserves), the species could be removed from the programme. The first assemblage of known site records from fungal herbaria yielded approximately 3500 records for all listed species. After 12 y of survey the total number of records increased four-fold to approximately 14400 records. Fifty-five percent of species were found at 20 or fewer sites and considered rare; 42 % were found at ten or fewer sites. Over the life of the programme, 39 species were removed from the programme primarily because they were no longer considered rare; many were found at several hundred sites throughout the NWFP area. Mapped distributions of known sites varied among species. When viewed across species, however, known sites were well distributed throughout the NWFP area, thus indicating the importance of the entire NWFP area in maintaining this diverse array of fungi. The NWFP relies on a system of late-successional forest reserves to act as a coarse-filter conservation approach to provide protection for late-successional species. Ninety percent of fungal species had some portion of their known sites within reserves, but only 34 % of total sites occurred within reserves. Thus, for the rarest species, applying a fine-filter conservation approach that protects known sites outside of reserves becomes an important aspect of species protection. The SMP became a costly and controversial aspect of the NWFP and underwent several administrative revisions including attempts to end the programme in 2004 and 2007. Regardless of costs and controversy, this conservation programme represents an unprecedented attempt to conserve rare fungal species at a regional scale. One of the more important lessons learned is the absolute need for professional mycologists to develop long-term partnerships with resource managers and other scientists, and apply mycological expertise to complex species and habitat conservation issues in an interdisciplinary setting.","Coarse-fine filter; Fungal rarity; Fungal reserves; Habitat conservation; Northwest Forest Plan","biological survey; fungus; habitat conservation; old-growth forest; rarity; species conservation; classification; ecosystem; environmental protection; fungus; isolation and purification; microbiology; review; species extinction; tree; United States; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Fungi; Pacific States; Trees; California; North America; Oregon; United States; Washington [United States]; Fungi","Molina, R.; USDA Forest Service, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States; email: molinar@onid.orst.edu",,,09537562,,MYCRE,"18486464","English","Mycol.

Significant amount of genetic variation was observed for most of the plant characteristics. All the accessions were grouped into 7 clusters on the basis of morphological similarities. Representative accessions from a cluster of particular group could be chosen for hybridization program. First five principal components having greater than 1 eigenvalue contributed more than 83.40% genetic variation. The PC1 accounted for 33.60% of the total variation. The characters contributing more positively to PC1 were grain yield, 1000 grain weight, heading days, maturity days, plant height, harvest index and biomass. Analysis on the basis of regions revealed that accessions from Northern Areas performed better for early heading, longer grain filling period, broader leaf area, short plant height and number of grains per spike. Long peduncle length was found in accessions from Baluchistan. NWFP material was good for harvest index, 1000 grain weight and tall stature. Scattered diagram based on average regional genetic diversity indicated that material from each region had its own distinctness and grouped them independently. The accessions from Northern Areas were altogether apart from the accessions belonging to NWFP and Baluchistan, while accessions from these provinces were closer to each other.

It examines how the use of NTFPs are influenced by intra-household variables, such as wealth and gender, and inter-community variables, such as accessibility to the natural resource. The results reveal that approximately 4453 kg of wild material is used annually per household, of which 1598 kg is used for cultural purposes. The influence of vegetation type and differences between villages are statistically more significant than inter-household variables. At an inter-household level, an increase in the financial status of households did not result in a decrease in the use of natural resources, nor in the quantity of material used. Similarly, gender only influenced the use of cultural resource use categories. Over 200 plant species were identified as being used, demonstrating the crucial role for biodiversity in rural livelihoods, which has implications for conservation of biodiversity also to occur outside of protected areas. An appreciation of the multitude of cultural values that affect the use of biodiversity would add value to biodiversity conservation approaches.","Community factors; Inter-household; NTFPs; Rural households; South Africa","biodiversity; natural resource; protected area; rural area; vegetation type; wild population; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa","Cocks, M.

In Pakistan, the conventional tillage practices are used for the production of wheat since long ago. The present concern about the environmental pollution due to the intensive tillage practices and high inorganic fertilization is an important issue. Field experiments were conducted at Agricultural Research Farm of NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar Pakistan during winter 2005-07 in Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with split plot arrangement having three replications. Twelve treatments of N, farmyard manure (FYM) and soybean residue (SR) management were arranged in subplots and three tillage practices [deep tillage (DT), conventional tillage (CT) and minimum tillage (MT)] in main plots. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of N sources under different tillage systems on wheat. The MT plots took less days to emergence, boot, anthesis, milk and maturity stages than CT and DT. Both MT and CT proved superior in terms of plant height as well as crop stand i.e. emergence m-2 and tiller m-2 as compared to DT and were statistically at par with each other. Likewise, among the N sources, FYM application @ of 20 tons ha-1 combined with 60 kg N ha-1 delayed phenology, but improved crop stand and plant height compared to all other treatments followed by 20 tons FYM ha-1 combined with 30 kg N ha-1. It is concluded that FYM application in combination with minimum N (30 or 60 kg N ha-1) is an alternative and sustainable practice for improving crop growth and stand.",,"Glycine max; Triticum aestivum","Khan, A.; NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Peshawar, 25000, Pakistan",,,05563321,,,,"English","Pak.

Amla (Phyllanthus emblica and Phyllanthus indofischeri) is a locally and nationally significant NTFP in India, exploited for its fruit. We examined the infection of these two species by a hemiparasitic mistletoe and investigated two alternative management approaches. Forest surveys, mistletoe removal experiments and seed deposition surveys were employed to assess the prevalence of mistletoe infection, characteristics of infection in relation to resource value and the appropriateness of local versus institutional management approaches. The results suggest mistletoe infection is widespread in the study site, affecting over half of the Amla population, and in particular those reproductive trees important for population persistence. Infection characteristics and resource values differ between the two Phyllanthus species, having significant implications for Amla collectors. Institutional perspectives on the management of this species conflict with local practice. Cutting of branches by collectors has previously been considered destructive, but may in fact have management benefits in terms of increased productivity through re-sprouts and reduced risk of mistletoe infection. However, neither mistletoe removal by hand, nor branch cutting appear to offer a viable control strategy in isolation. A multifarious strategy including new approaches to management is needed to safeguard the role of this resource in local livelihoods. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, research on the financial rewards from NTFP collection and its contribution to sustainable development is equivocal. In a case study in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, India, we examined whether NTFP collection can solve livelihood problems by analysing revenues obtained from various NTFP species, estimating the economic returns to collectors from various social backgrounds, and exploring the attitudes of collectors towards their profession. We found that black damar resin from the tree Canarium strictum (61.3%) and mace from Myristica spp. (35.5%) were the most commonly collected NTFPs, and the most valuable NTFPs were honey from Apis cerana indica (USD 4.12 kg-1), cardamom Elettaria cardamomum (USD 3.67 kg-1) and Myristica spp. (USD 2.77 kg-1). Mean daily revenue from NTFP collection was USD 3.15 ± SD 4.19 day-1, and the lowest daily revenues were earned by part-time collectors with low socio-economic status such as migrants, forest-dwellers or those without access to agricultural land. Most collectors (82%) did not wish to continue harvesting NTFPs if alternative livelihoods from agriculture could be provided, and none wanted their children to be NTFP collectors. Our findings suggest that, with respect to social justice, poverty alleviation and environmental sustainability, the role of NTFP collection in sustainable development is questionable. © 2008 Fauna &amp; Flora International.","Forest economics; India; Livelihoods; NTFP; Periyar Tiger Reserve; Poverty alleviation","environmental economics; honey; nature conservation; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; protected area; resin; socioeconomic status; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; Asia; Eurasia; India; Kerala; Periyar Tiger Reserve; South Asia; Apis cerana indica; Canarium strictum; Elettaria cardamomum; Myristica","Gubbi, S.; Wildlife Conservation Society-India Program, 1669, 31st Cross, 16th Main, Banashankari 2nd Stage, Bengalooru 560 082, India; email: gubbi@wcsindia.org",,,00306053,,ORYXA,,"English","ORYX",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149163416

Although tree species display many characteristics that increase their potential for sustainable use, the approach is rarely successful in practice. The reasons for this are examined with reference to case studies, considering five conditions needed for success: (1) sustainable harvesting, (2) no interaction between threats, (3) successful commercialization, (4) economic benefits received by producers, and (5) use of financial income to support conservation action. Case studies illustrate that even when the first four of these conditions are met, trade in forest products often provides insufficient financial returns to protect the forest against other threats. This highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between threats for conservation-through-use to be achieved, an issue illustrated by a conceptual model. Recommendations are presented indicating how the conservation of tree species through sustainable use may be achieved in practice. Critically, financial rewards of sustainable use need to be large enough to support practical conservation action, which is required to counter the many threats to which tree species are exposed. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.","Conservation-through-use; Non-timber forest product; NTFP; Sustainable use; Timber; Tree","conservation planning; cost-benefit analysis; nature conservation; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; timber harvesting","Newton, A.

Based on interviews with local, non-local and foreign harvesters in Laos we examined the relationships between harvesters' daily net revenue from agarwood extraction, their degree of commercialization (i.e. their differential access to markets) and their ability to target harvesting towards the small fraction of trees that do contain commercial qualities and quantities of agarwood. For comparison we included data on number of trees felled during the most recent harvesting trip. The analysis showed that poor targeting ability and low degree of commercialization were associated with low daily net revenues, whereas good targeting ability and high degree of commercialization were associated with high daily net revenues. In the case of A. crassna in Laos it therefore appears that the activities of highly commercialized harvesters are less harmful to A. crassna populations than those of less specialized, local harvesters. © 2008 Fauna & Flora International.","Agarwood; Aquilaria crassna; Gaharu; Laos; Non-timber forest product; NTFP; South-east Asia","CITES; commercialization; dicotyledon; ecological impact; endangered species; harvesting; nontimber forest product; Red List; Asia; Eurasia; Laos; Southeast Asia; Aquilaria crassna","Jensen, A.; University of Copenhagen, Rolighedsvej 23, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; email: anderslaos@yahoo.co.uk",,,00306053,,ORYXA,,"English","ORYX",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149174275

We address four topics: (1) views and values people have relating to biodiversity, (2) the resource use and management practices of local forest users and their effects on biodiversity, (3) methods and models for integrating traditional and local ecological knowledge into biodiversity conservation on public and private lands, and (4) challenges to applying traditional and local ecological knowledge for biodiversity conservation. We focus on the ecological knowledge of three groups who inhabit the region: American Indians, family forest owners, and commercial nontimber forest product (NTFP) harvesters. Integrating traditional and local ecological knowledge into forest biodiversity conservation is most likely to be successful if the knowledge holders are directly engaged with forest managers and western scientists in on-the-ground projects in which interaction and knowledge sharing occur. Three things important to the success of such efforts are understanding the communication styles of knowledge holders, establishing a foundation of trust to work from, and identifying mutual benefits from knowledge sharing that create an incentive to collaborate for biodiversity conservation. Although several promising models exist for how to integrate traditional and local ecological knowledge into forest management, a number of social, economic, and policy constraints have prevented this knowledge from flourishing and being applied. These constraints should be addressed alongside any strategy for knowledge integration.","American Indians; Biodiversity conservation; Family forest owners; Forest management; Nontimber forest product harvesters; Pacific Northwest; Traditional ecological knowledge","biodiversity; ecological modeling; forest management; habitat conservation; nontimber forest product; private land; resource management; resource use; traditional knowledge; North America; Pacific Northwest","Chamley, S.; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 620 SW Main St., Portland, OR 97205, United States",,,08874840,,,,"English","USDA For.

The forests are mainly found in the sub-humid zone of the country, and are very fragmented due to human activities, generally reduced to forested strips along waterways. Sacred forests in Togo are protected by the local communities. In this very constraining forestry context, our study aims to reconsider these sacred forests as important centres of biodiversity and promote their inclusion in frameworks of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management (SFM). Our results are based on research that has been undertaken for more than 10 years, and show that local communities have a greater respect for riverside and sacred forests than they do for government protected areas which are being degraded. Several of these forest fragments are modern relics of old and disappearing plant communities in Togo. Our inventories show that there are 1500 taxa in these areas, representing ∼45.5% of the local and introduced flowering plants of Togo. Some of the plant species are not found outside the forest fragments. Plant diversity is higher than that found in the surrounding vegetation communities. In the sacred forests, harvesting of minor NTFPs is frequent, while in the riparian forests timber harvesting is having an impact. Unfortunately, threats to the forest are numerous, leading to their disappearance. Many species recorded are potentially threatened because of the current pressure being placed on the forest fragments. It is in this sense that our study provides essential information aimed at valuing these sacred forest fragments which, up until now, have not been addressed in the criteria and indicator frameworks of SFM. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing concern over the sustainability of harvesting non-timber forest products (NTFP) has led to a growing literature on the ecological impacts of NTFP extraction. A large proportion of NTFP are harvested for multiple plant parts, but few studies have assessed the impacts of harvesting multi-use species. In addition, few studies have assessed how harvest effects may vary across space. This information is necessary for designing effective conservation plans for the many NTFP species that are harvested from variable ecological contexts. 2. This study assessed the impacts of combined bark and foliage harvest on Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) reproductive performance in Benin. K. senegalensis bark is an important medicine for malaria, the leaves are pruned by indigenous Fulani herders as a critical source of fodder for their livestock, and the timber is highly prized. Data on reproductive characteristics were collected from 12 populations spread across two ecological regions (Sudanian and Sudano-Guinean). Half the populations had a history of high harvest intensity and half were subject to low/no harvest. 3. Trees produced more fruit and began fruiting at a significantly smaller size in the drier Sudanian region than in the wetter Sudano-Guinean region. However, pruning decreased fruit production significantly in the Sudanian region but not in the Sudano-Guinean region. Pruning had a significantly greater impact on fruit production in larger trees than in smaller trees. High harvest populations in the Sudano-Guinean region had significantly higher rates of seed production than low harvest populations, although the seeds were significantly lighter. There were no significant effects of debarking or combined debarking and pruning on reproductive performance. 4. Synthesis and applications. This study illustrates that heavy rates of foliage harvest can decrease rates and patterns of reproduction in K. senegalensis, and that the impacts may vary across environmental contexts. Lowered rates of reproduction may lead to decreases in K. senegalensis population size over the long term. Effective ex situ conservation strategies for K. senegalensis include increasing the availability of its fodder and bark by promoting K. senegalensis plantations programmes involving Fulani harvesters. © 2007 The Authors.","Ecological variation; Fruit production; Fulani; Multiple use species; Non-timber forest products; West Africa","angiosperm; bark; ecological impact; foliage; fruit production; harvesting; nontimber forest product; plantation; population size; reproduction; seed production; Africa; Benin [West Africa]; East Africa; Guinea; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sudan; West Africa; Animalia; Khaya senegalensis; Meliaceae","Gaoue, O.G.; Botany Department, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, United States; email: ogaoue@hawaii.edu",,,00218901,,JAPEA,,"English","J.

Despite significant interest in the sustainable use of medicinal plants, the population ecology of many medicinal plant species remains unstudied. Also, few demographic studies have compared effects of harvesting across habitats. We studied the demography of a highly threatened perennial Himalayan medicinal herb, Nardostachys grandiflora, in two habitats and examined effects of indigenous harvesting regimes on its population dynamics. 2. In a rocky-outcrop population in 1998, different levels of rhizome harvesting were applied directly by the local users. In meadows, we sampled an unharvested population and another population that was commercially harvested. Data on recruitment, growth and survival of individuals classified by size were gathered over 4 years. 3. Population growth rate (λ) was significantly higher in the unharvested meadow population than in control subplots of the outcrop population. Harvesting significantly reduced λ. Matrix model projections revealed that the size of outcrop populations would return to initial values within ≈5 years, only after 10% rhizome harvesting. In other treatments, recovery time varied from 17 (25% harvesting) to 33 (75%) years. In contrast, in the commercially harvested meadow population (with harvesting levels >25%), projected recovery time was 6 years. 4. Higher growth rates and faster recovery in meadow populations appear to be due to higher recruitment and faster vegetative growth. In outcrops, slow growth and low fecundity slow down recovery after harvesting. 5. Synthesis and application. Nardostachys grandiflora is extremely sensitive to harvesting of rhizomes, but this sensitivity is higher in outcrop than in meadow habitats. Given the constraints on its population growth and its high sensitivity to harvesting, N. grandiflora should be strictly managed, with low harvest rates (<10% in outcrop and <25% in meadow) and fairly long rotations (at least 5 years) between successive harvests. This work shows the importance of considering demographic variation across habitats when formulating specific management plans for threatened medicinal plants. It also demonstrates the importance of integrating local harvesting practices in ecological research for informing management. A large proportion of high-altitude perennial medicinal plants may be expected to be similarly sensitive to exploitation, requiring careful management to achieve sustainable harvesting. © 2007 The Authors.","Conservation ecology; Ethnoecology; Himalaya; Medicinal plant conservation; Nepal; NTFP; Population dynamics","demography; fecundity; growth rate; harvesting; herb; medicinal plant; outcrop; perennial plant; population dynamics; population ecology; population growth; population viability analysis; recruitment (population dynamics); species conservation; Asia; Eurasia; Himalayas; Nepal; South Asia; Nardostachys; Nardostachys grandiflora","Ghimire, S.K.; Central Department of Botany, , Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal; email: sureshkghimire@yahoo.com",,,00218901,,JAPEA,,"English","J.

Small-scale, poor collectors and farmers will encounter difficulties in benefiting from existing opportunities unless supported by external organizations. Without a focused and continuous support of poor NTFP collectors, the efforts for NTFP certification in China, may, in the extreme, even devitalise the traditional NTFP markets that have immense importance for the rural poor. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fair Trade; Food quality; Organic certification; Product quality certification; Regional/geographical certification; Sustainable forest management standards; Wild collection standards","food quality; forest management; forest resource; nontimber forest product; rural development; sustainable forestry; timber certification; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",,,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

Eventually the two concepts were merged and proposed as a marketing option for NTFP producers in both temperate and tropical countries. This paper examines the experiences of NTFP certification within the Forest Stewardship Council over the past eight years. We describe some of the impediments that NTFP producers have encountered in obtaining certification, as well as successes. We find that certification and NTFPs are often incompatible. For those cases where NTFP certification is warranted, we offer several suggestions for improving the likelihood of success. The triumph of neoliberalism in international trade and aid circles all but assures continued commercialization of NTFPs. Certification may help ensure the environmental sustainability of such initiatives but it must not become a tool to exclude gatherers and or threaten local livelihoods. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Development; Forest harvesting; Forest management; Forest policy; International trade","commercialization; forest management; forest resource; forestry production; international trade; neoliberalism; nontimber forest product; rainforest; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; timber certification",,,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

Besides benefiting efforts at certification, such attention can foster needed appreciation and local documentation of traditional ecological knowledge.

Pakistan joined the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative in 2001. This led to development of a 5 year roll back malaria strategy. The aim of the paper is to audit whether the malaria control programme in NWFP was able to implement strategies suggested by RBM initiative in the year 2002-2005, and its subsequent effect on the number of cases of malaria confirmed by peripheral blood smear/slide (confirmed cases), confirmed cases of plasmodium Falciparum (P. Falciparum) and annual parasite incidence (API). METHODS: Data was obtained from the malaria control programme (MCP), directorate general health services, Peshawar. We examined budget allocation and its breakdown for financial years 2002-2005 and standard surveillance proformae (data sheets) containing summated data. Data had been totalled from all first level care public health facilities (outpatient facilities) in 24 districts for 2001-2005. This was further totalled by the malaria control programme to give annual figures for the entire province. The data from the province contained information on, the total no of slides examined by active case detection, (ACD) passive case detection, (PCD) cases of malaria confirmed by peripheral blood slide examination, total number of cases of plasmodium Falciparum (API) confirmed by peripheral blood slide examination and annual parasite incidence (API) for 2001-2005. RESULTS: budget allocation fell from rupees 5.043 million in 2002 to rupees 3.3 million in 2005. In 2002 malaria control programme purchased 400,000 blood lancets and 437 kg more insecticide than the consecutive years, but all other items purchased were the same. By the end of 2005, 925 medical officers and 67 microscopists had been trained in case management and diagnostic techniques (according to who guidelines) in 16 districts of NWFP in a phased manner. Budget for training was not allocated from the provincial malaria control programme. The total number of slides examined in 2005 was 62% more than 2001. the number of slides collected by active case detection increased by 68% and passive case detection increased by 55.7% from 2001 to 2005. Total number of malaria cases confirmed by peripheral blood smear peaked in 2002 and 2003 and then fell in 2004. In 2005, the number of malaria cases confirmed by peripheral blood smears were similar to those reported in 2001. Annual parasite incidence (API) peaked in 2002 and 2003 to 3.01 and 3.57 per 1000 respectively, it fell in 2004 and in 2005. API was reported to be 2.01 per 1000 in 2005, this was double the rate reported in 2001, i.e., 1.09 per 1000. The confirmed cases of plasmodium Falciparum peaked in 2002 and 2003, the number of cases decreased in 2004, and by 2005, the number of cases reported were similar to 2001. CONCLUSION: NWFP was committed to roll back malaria initiative but it appears that it was unable to implement the strategy, because of the lack of a parallel commitment in resources. Although annual figures illustrate activity in the malaria control programme, inferences have not been drawn from the data. There is no evidence to suggest that information is disseminated or any feedback is given to the districts and the first level health care facilities. The malaria control programme does not appear to have capacity or resources to change policy or implement change based on evidence depicted by the data.",,"animal; article; health care quality; health survey; human; incidence; isolation and purification; malaria; medical audit; Pakistan; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; prevalence; program development; Animals; Humans; Incidence; Malaria; Medical Audit; Pakistan; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium vivax; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Program Development; Program Evaluation","Asif, S.A.email: sab_asif22@hotmail.com",,,10259589,,,"19024199","English","J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149373709

This study employs a cross-disciplinary, regional approach to identify some of the links between patterns of harvest, trade, and conservation of one of South India's most heavily harvested resins, Canarium strictum Roxb. (Burseraceae), or black dammar. We focus on indigenous communities in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR) and ask: How is C. strictum tapped and is there variation across communities? How is C. strictum resin sold and bought, and what trade routes are involved? What are the impacts of tapping on C. strictum trees and population structure? We carried out interviews and focus-group discussions with harvesters in eight villages in three different regions, and with buyers and traders inside and outside of the NBR. We also established twenty-two 20 × 20 m plots to document population structure. Three broad resin-harvest strategies were identified: collection from natural fissures, tapping using incisions, and tapping using incisions and fire, each practiced in a different region. However, within each strategy there was large variation in tapping frequency and timing, tenure practices, and resin quality. The loss of tree tenure in some areas has led to a higher frequency of tapping and to the production of lower quality, lower value resin. Factors driving changes in both tenure and tapping strategies include rising commercial demand and value, pressure from outside harvesters, changes in livelihood strategies, and habitat destruction. Tapping leads to elevated mortality of C. strictum adults, with firetapping have a greater negative impact than tapping with no fire. The combination of social and ecological approaches used here provides insight on strategies for better conservation of C. strictum. These include the promotion of tapping and sale of only high-grade resin-which is a good indicator of sustainable harvest - enrichment planting to help address some of the underlying causes of overharvest, and sparing of some trees for increased reproduction.

Consumers in this market now seek independent assurances relating to the quality, environmental sustainability and Fair Trade standards of the products they buy. Small-scale producers of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) that feed into this market have found themselves drawn centre stage into often complex, shifting and expensive certification scenarios that, also, may be serving as a barrier to trade. However, certification can increase benefit-flows to small-scale producers and incentives for producers to invest in more sustainable harvesting practices. If the gap between the industry's certification expectations and the small-scale producers' certification capacity is wide, there is a likelihood that small-scale producers will be excluded. This paper presents a case study of the experiences of PhytoTrade Africa, a southern Africa-based natural product Trade Association that has attempted to bridge this gap, overcoming barriers to trade in practical ways to allow entry for small-scale NTFP producers into the global natural products market. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fair trade; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Organic; Southern Africa","forest management; forest resource; nontimber forest product; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; timber certification; timber harvesting; Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",,,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

The index values reveal significant differences in cost of living across Pakistan and especially across provinces with prices significantly higher in Balochistan (overall) and NWFP (for wheat). When regressed against various explanatory variables, the variation in cost of living appears to be determined by the population in cubic form (reaching a minimum for a city size of 2.1 million) and the provincial affiliation of cities. The index also reveals that relative to 1999, the economy as a whole appears to have become less integrated as the difference in prices across cities is much greater than in 1999. However, cities in Sindh due to their close proximity to the port have become less expensive because of the increased share of imports in consumption.

A large part of the earthquake-affected area is difficult to access and highly snowprone, with rugged terrain and scattered settlements. It posed unique challenges and efforts on a massive-scale for reconstruction. For residential buildings, the Pakistan government adopted a house-owner driven approach. The reconstruction policy stated that the government and other agencies would provide equal technical assistance and subsidy to each family, without differentiating between who lost what. To increase capacity in earthquake-resistant construction, large-scale training of artisans, technicians, engineers, and community mobilisers has been conducted. Campaigns to ""build back better"" have raised awareness in the communities.

The results reveal that most of the top ranked districts are located in the province of Punjab which tends to indicate that Punjab is ahead of other provinces in terms of objective well-being. Sindh and NWFP districts are dominated in the category of lower medium well-being category. At the lower end of the distribution districts of Balochistan emerged in lowest category of well-being. It is observed that Punjab have highest share of population in top category of well-being while population of Balochistan gets major share in lowest category of wellbeing. It is important to note that those districts which have higher achievements in hard facts of well-being, acquire less subjective well-being in term of satisfaction. Districts of Balochistan, with least developed indicators, perception about the quality of life is evident in their lowest level of satisfaction. Since the underlying premise of the MDGs is still the concept of human development, so priorities is needed to concentrate on least developed districts for achieving the MDGs by 2015.","Measurement; Objective; Quality of life; Subjective; Well-being","conference proceeding; human development index; income distribution; living standard; Millenium Development Goal; quality of life; residential satisfaction; socioeconomic indicator; socioeconomic status; socioeconomic survey; Baluchistan; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Sind","Haq, R.; Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Islamabad, Pakistan; email: rashida_haq@hotmail.com",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

A woman's right to life-saving services of skilled health care providers in childbirth is undeniable. This paper examines factors restricting women's access to emergency obstetric care services in Pakistan. METHOD: This cross-sectional survey on emergency obstetric care services collected information at the health facility level using UN process indicators. The study enrolled 170 health facilities from nineteen randomly selected districts in Punjab and NWFP. RESULTS: Diverse factors limit women's access to Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) services. EmOC services were unavailable in most health facilities surveyed. Staff absenteeism, geographic remoteness, delayed access, and ambulance shortages jeopardize the transferral of seriously ill patients to higher level care facilities. Cultural norms dictate that women should be examined by women doctors, whose dearth makes these services inaccessible. CONCLUSION: Many maternal deaths would be avoidable if EmOC health services were accessible. The geographic obstacles to timely access, poor hospital infrastructure, and high staff absenteeism rates require immediate attention. Health facilities' working hours were inconsistent with the provision of around-the-clock essential services, depriving and endangering the lives of many in need.

First, experimentally stripped 1 m long cylindrats on 46 shrub stems in the Oregon Coast Range were monitored for species composition and abundance annually during the first five years of recovery and again in year 10. Second, a pathway of community development was inferred by examining the relative species composition and abundance of epiphytic species present in moss mats in a four-stage chronosequence. We (1) characterized the change in richness and composition from year 1 through 10 of regrowth following experimental disturbance, (2) quantified the proportion of ∼1-, 10-, 25-, and 50-year-old moss mats of commercially harvestable species that were monodominant, diverse, and late successional, and (3) contrasted these proportions with estimates from a compositional transition matrix derived from long-term monitoring. Roughly half of the observed moss mats demonstrated neutral dynamics and were composed of a mixture of readily dispersed acrocarps and pleurocarps. The remaining half exhibited positive dynamics and were dominated by aggressively growing pleurocarpous species such as Isothecium myosuroides. Following structural developmental pathways well established for vascular plants, moss mats shift with time from high diversity and evenness in the initial colonization and extended establishment phases to increasing Isothecium dominance during a presumed competitive-exclusion phase. Old mats exist in alternate states of either Isothecium dominance or mixed composition, either of which may have late-successional species. Patchy historic commercial moss harvest likely facilitated high diversity by increasing the simultaneous occurrence of all moss mat age classes, while modern strip harvesting methods are predicted to promote predominantly even-aged mats that are unlikely to reach ""old-growth"" conditions before re-harvest. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Coast range; Colonization; Epiphyte; Harvest impacts; Matrix model; Nontimber forest product; NTFP; Oregon; SFP; Vine maple","abundance; anthropogenic effect; coast; colonization; community composition; demography; dominance; epiphyte; experimental study; harvesting; moss; nontimber forest product; regrowth; succession; understory; vascular plant; article; growth, development and aging; moss; United States; Bryophyta; Northwestern United States; North America; Oregon; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); United States; Acer circinatum; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Isothecium; Isothecium myosuroides; Tracheophyta","Peck, J.

Through the lens of one of the most revered and economically important trees in Africa, marula (Sclerocarya birrea), NTFP governance is explored in case studies across South Africa and Namibia. Results are presented from a study that examined the interface between statutory and customary rules and regulations governing marula conservation and use. The major finding is that 'less' is often 'more' when it comes to government regulation of marula, a result that resonates with other NTFP studies from around the world that indicate the need for state-led interventions to be purposely crafted to reflect local circumstances and needs. Such interventions are also most effective when government and traditional authorities cooperate, authorities have legitimacy and sufficient capacity, and there is acceptance of the rules by user groups. It is suggested that state intervention may be least useful where traditional governance is strong, and with the exception of areas and cases in which customary law and traditional authority fall short and commercial pressures on species are significant, governments might do best by leaving well enough alone.","Commercialisation; Customary law; Marula; Non-timber forest products; Policy","angiosperm; biodiversity; commercialization; forestry policy; governance approach; nontimber forest product; policy approach; regulatory approach; rural development; Africa; Namibia; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sclerocarya birrea","Wynberg, R.P.; Environmental Evaluation Unit, , Rondebosch 7701, South Africa; email: rachel@iafrica.com",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

However, the degree to which forest resource extraction is compatible with new conservation aims is unclear because there is little information on the specific ecological effects of traditional forest collecting practices. Therefore, we compared the structure and floristics of Pinus densata forests exposed to three levels of resource extraction by Tibetan villages in northwest Yunnan: (1) a forest site protected from wood and timber removal, (2) moderately utilized forest sites exposed to traditional collecting practices, and (3) patches of highly utilized forest from which timber extraction is high in response to recent development pressures. The results show that understorey and cryptogamic species are reduced in all the utilized forest sites by comparison with the protected forest. However, the moderately utilized pine forests still provide good NTFP habitats by maintaining relatively high canopy covers, litter covers, and understorey structural complexity; this suggests that traditional forest resource use, while simplifying the forest, does not pose an increasing threat to pine forest integrity. By comparison, the highly utilized forests are transformed into open, herb-rich environments in which canopy covers and understorey complexity are depleted, and NTFP habitats are degraded. In the future it may be practical to enhance biodiversity by proscribing forest resource collection, but the immediate priority is to monitor the sustainability of forest utilization using indicators such as understorey development, litter cover, and cryptogamic richness. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Community forest; Fuelwood; Logging ban; Non-timber forest products; Northwest Yunnan; Pinus densata","Community forest; Logging ban; Non-timber forest products; Northwest Yunnan; Pinus densata; Biodiversity; Environmental management; Sustainable development; Forestry; fuel; biodiversity; comparative study; coniferous forest; forest ecosystem; forest resource; habitat fragmentation; nontimber forest product; protected area; rural area; stand structure; article; biodiversity; canopy; China; deforestation; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; forest management; forest structure; herb; logging; pine; Pinus densata; plant litter; rural area; understorey; wood; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Pinus; Trees; Biodiversity; Forestry; Sustainable Forest Management; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Xizang; Yunnan; Animalia; Pinus densata","Melick, D.R.; WWF South Pacific, PO Box 8280, Boroko NCD, 111, Papua New Guinea; email: dmelick@wwfpacific.org.pg",,,0364152X,,EMNGD,"17846828","English","Environ.

SNGPL is the only gas transportation company in Pakistan, which is utilizing the SCADA system on such a large scale, with much effect. The SCADA system, implemented in SNGPL since 2000, has greatly changed the corporate profile and organizational procedures as well as the public image of the company. DMC phones and traditional tele-printer messages were mainly used for the communication/dissipation of information across the organization before the implementation of SCADA. No timely or abrupt response could have been given to any sabotage/rupture of pipelines, mainly due to lack of an effective and efficient information system throughout the organization. Nowadays, while monitoring mainline pressure and flow at Gas Control Center Faisalabad, the desk operator would immediately issue a command to close the nearest valve, not only to save the gas volume being purged into the atmosphere but also to ensure the safety of precious human lives and public property. Moreover, the companys image in the consumer market has improved greatly due to an uninterrupted gas supply to all major cities and towns of Punjab and NWFP. In short, SCADA has proved to be a blessing in disguise for SNGPL, keeping in view its widely spread infrastructure.","Control; MIS; RTU; SCADA; SNGPL","DMC phones; Tele-printer messages; Image analysis; Information management; Information systems; Message passing; Quality management; SCADA systems","Shahid Khalil, M.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Pakistan",,,17433517,9781845640811,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Wheat lines and check cultivars were 2 to 5 days early in heading under rainfed environment compared to the irrigated. Plant height, spike length, 1000-grain weight, biological and grain yields were generally reduced under rainfed environment. Genetic variances were of greater magnitude than environmental variances for most of the traits in both environments. The heritability estimates were of higher magnitude (0.74 to 0.96) for days to heading, plant height, spike length, biological and grain yield, while medium (0.31 to 0.51) for 1000-grain weight.

Tight linkages between Brazil nut production, regional income, and intact mature forests have thrust this species into focus as a key component of Amazonian conservation and income generation strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive synthesis of factors explaining Brazil nut fruit production variation is lacking. We aimed to address this knowledge gap, asking: (1) What are the rates and annual variation of Bertholletia excelsa fruit production at individual and population levels? (2) What factors explain B. excelsa production variation, focusing on spatial and temporal variables, diameter at breast height (dbh), crown attributes, liana loads, and soil attributes? and (3) Does liana cutting affect fruit production? Our model explained 73% of the variability in fruit production by 140 trees over 5 years. Dbh alone explained >50%, and trees in the middle diameter range (100 cm ≤ dbh < 150 cm) produced best. Top-producing trees were loosely grouped spatially. Cation exchange capacity and P also explained production variation. The liana load variable was only weakly significant for explaining production variation, and there were no direct significant effects of liana cutting. Cutting, however, did improve crown forms-another highly significant model variable. This, coupled with a weakly significant interaction of liana cutting by year, suggests that liana cutting could improve production over time. In any given year, approximately 25% of the trees produced 72% of the total population production. Annual variation of fruit production at the individual level was relatively high, and at the population level was extremely low, with annual production departing from average only in a year of delayed and reduced rainfall. These results coupled with low synchronicity of fruiting, confirm long-term observations of harvesters that Brazil nut populations exhibit relatively constant fruit production. Results suggest that fruit productivity at the individual tree level could be increased, possibly through experimental liana cutting and/or P amendments. At the population level, Brazil nut collectors could potentially increase efficiency by concentrating collection efforts on consistently high producers and possible production ""hotspots"". © 2007.","Amazon; Bertholletia excelsa; Liana; Non-timber forest product; NTFP; Nut production; Nutrients; Seed production; Tropical forest","Economic analysis; Forestry; Nutrients; Rain; Soils; Bertholletia excelsa; Liana; Nut production; Seed production; Tropical forest; Fruits; economy of scale; fruit production; nontimber forest product; regional economy; seed production; temporal variation; tropical forest; woody plant; Economic Analysis; Forestry; Fruits; Rain; Soil; Amazonia; South America; Bertholletia excelsa","Kainer, K.A.; School of Forest Resources and Conservation, , Gainesville, FL 32611, United States; email: kkainer@ufl.edu",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The objectives of this study were to estimate selection differential, expected and observed response to selection and heritability for maydis leaf blight resistance and grain yield and to determine progress from selection in a maize population. Two cycles of S1 recurrent selection were conducted in broad based maize population, Sarhad White (SW). One hundred S1 lines were compared with their respective original population (C0) as a check. The experimental material was evaluated under artificial epiphytotics during 2003 and 2004, at NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar. Selection differentials, expected responses and heritability estimates were determined from the replicated S1 lines performance of the first cycle. The observed progress was estimated from the replicated S1 lines of the second cycle that were generated after recombination of selected S1 lines of the first cycle. Highly significant variations between the cycles were observed for MLB and grain yield. Moderate and high heritability estimates, desirable selection differentials and close correspondence of expected and observed response were manifested for MLB and grain yield. The positive percent deviation of inoculated from uninoculated trials in both cycles (C1 = 71% and C2 = 41%) for leaf blight indicated successful development of blight disease after artificial inoculation, while the negative percent deviation of inoculated form uninoculated trials (C1 = -21 and C 2 = -6%) for grain yield indicated the impact of blight disease on grain yield. Blight disease was significantly reduced from 2.9 to 2.3, whereas, grain yield was significantly increased from 2041 kg ha-1 cycle -1 to 2527 kg ha-1 cycle-1 or 19% cycle -1. This yield improvement in SW was probably the result of concomitant reduction in the blight disease severity by -26%. These findings suggested that S1 recurrent selection was quite effective in improving disease resistance and grain yield. Nevertheless, some additional cycles of selection may be required to further improving grain yield and resistance level to maydis leaf blight in SW maize population. © 2007 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Heritability; Maydis leaf blight; Recurrent selection; S 1 lines; Selection differential; Simultaneous improvement","Cochliobolus heterostrophus; Zea mays","Hidayat-Ur-Rahman; Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, , Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Asian Network for Scientific Information",10288880,,,"19093473","English","Pak.

Use of smokeless tobacco is common in South Asia. Tobacco is a major preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. Doctors make one of the best avenues to influence patients' tobacco use. However, medical students addicted to tobacco are likely to retain this habit as physicians and are unlikely to counsel patients against using tobacco. With this background, this study was conducted with the objective of determining the prevalence of smokeless tobacco among Pakistani medical students. Methods. A cross sectional study was carried out in three medical colleges of Pakistan - one from the north and two from the southern region. 1025 students selected by convenient sampling completed a peer reviewed, pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire. Questions were asked regarding lifetime use (at least once or twice in their life), current use (at least once is the last 30 days), and established use (more than 100 times in their life) of smokeless tobacco. Chi square and logistic regression analyses were used. Results. Two hundred and twenty (21.5%) students had used tobacco in some form (smoked or smokeless) in their lifetime. Sixty six (6.4%) students were lifetime users of smokeless tobacco. Thirteen (1.3%) were daily users while 18 (1.8%) fulfilled the criterion for established users. Niswar was the most commonly used form of smokeless tobacco followed by paan and nass. Most naswar users belonged to NWFP while most paan users studied in Karachi. On univariate analysis, lifetime use of smokeless tobacco showed significant associations with the use of cigarettes, student gender (M > F), student residence (boarders > day scholars) and location of the College (NWFP > Karachi). Multivariate analysis showed independent association of lifetime use of smokeless tobacco with concomitant cigarette smoking, student gender and location of the medical college. Conclusion. The use of smokeless tobacco among medical students cannot be ignored. The governments should add the goal of eliminating smokeless tobacco to existing drives against cigarette smoking. Drives in Karachi should focus more on eliminating paan usage while those in NWFP should focus more on the use of naswar. Medical colleges should provide greater education about the myths and hazards of smokeless tobacco. © 2007 Imam et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; article; chi square test; cross-sectional study; female; human; logistic regression analysis; male; medical school; medical student; Pakistan; prevalence; questionnaire; residency education; smokeless tobacco; attitude to health; chi square distribution; comparative study; medical student; methodology; psychological aspect; smoking cessation; statistics; Adult; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Pakistan; Questionnaires; Schools, Medical; Students, Medical; Tobacco Use Cessation; Tobacco, Smokeless","Imam, S.Z.; Department of Surgery (ENT, Head and Neck Division), , Karachi, Pakistan; email: zakariya.imam@gmail.com",,,14712458,,,"17767719","English","BMC Public Health",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848867787

The experiment was laid out in randomized complete block design with split-plot arrangement having 3 replications. The main plot consisted of conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) while Zn application methods were assigned to the subplots which included seed priming (dry seed, soaking seed in water, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03% Zn solutions), foliar spray of 0.01% Zn solution, soil application @ of 5 kg ha-1 and combination of soil application (@ 5 kg ha-1) plus foliar spray (0.01%&gt; Zn solution). Tillage significantly affected weed density (WD) and yield of maize. CT suppressed WD recorded 21 and 42 days after sowing (DAS). Likewise, CT also suppressed the major weeds viz., Cyperus rotundus, Digitaria sanguinalis and Convolvulus arvensis. Higher grain yield was recorded in CT plots as compared to RT. Zinc application methods significantly affected WD recorded 42 days after sowing and grain yield of maize. The interaction between tillage and Zn application methods for WD recorded 42 DAS was also significant. Greater WD was recorded in RT as compared to CT. Mean of the interaction values indicated that WD was lower in CT as compared to RT irrespective of Zn application methods. Yield was higher in CT as compared to RT. Likewise water soaking and Zn application methods improved maize yield as compared to control. It is concluded that CT resulted in lower WD and higher yield of maize.

Yet, surprisingly few efforts have been made to value them comprehensively. Valuation efforts usually focused on selected NTFPs traded on formal markets, at local level. This paper aims to provide comprehensive estimates of NTFPs benefits at national and regional level in the Mediterranean region. Six major groups of NTFPs are identified: firewood, cork, fodder, mushrooms, honey and other NTFPs. Valuation is based on a wide variety of techniques, drawing on official statistics, and supplemented by results of local surveys. It shows that at Mediterranean level, NTFPs provide annual benefits of about €39/ha of forests, accounting for about a fourth of the total economic value of forests estimated by this study. The average estimate for southern countries (€54/ha) is considerably higher than for northern (€41/ha) and eastern countries (€20/ha). The paper reveals the degree of importance of the main NTFPs benefits for the country groups and the region as a whole. It also discusses some reasons of concern when drawing policy tools for improving rural income and forest conservation in the Mediterranean. © 2007.","Mediterranean forests; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs)","environmental economics; forest management; nontimber forest product; policy strategy; rural finance; sustainable development; sustainable forestry; valuation; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Basidiomycota","Croitoru, L.; World Bank, Middle East and North Africa Region, 1818 H St, NW Washington, DC 20433, United States; email: lelia.croitoru@gmail.com",,,09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

Nevertheless, despite decades of the donor's interventions the deforestation rate in NWFP is still alarming. In this paper we have attempted to analyze the participatory forest management in Northwest Pakistan through livelihood lenses. More specifically this paper explores the impact of joint forest management initiatives on financial assets and livelihood strategies of local people. The overall results indicated that majority of the respondents were not dependent on the natural resources for their cash income rather they had adopted diverse non-natural resource based activities such as migration, labour etc. The results also indicated that the main priorities of the local people were financial and food security; where as the NWFP model of joint forest management gives more emphasis on forest protection and regeneration. Although the joint forest management enhanced the social assets of the local communities yet the omission of immediate financial benefits from the institutional changes in the forestry sector of NWFP was a barrier in motivating the local people in forest protection and was one of the main issues hindering the effectiveness of the forest reforms process. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve (AHFR) in Puchong, Selangor, is known to have all the treasured heritage of a rich forest. Nevertheless, due to its strategic location in combination with the current pressure for socio-economic development, the possibility of AHFR being converted into some other uses cannot be ruled out. Every effort must be made to quantify the treasures of AHFR as a centre for research and education, as well as a provider of other environmental services. To date, various scientific studies have been conducted in AHFR, including economic valuation of its timber and identification of its flora and fauna. The identification of the flora, especially medicinal plants, thus far has not involved any form of economic valuation.

Concerns over NTFP overexploitation has led to a growing number of studies on the ecological impacts of harvest. Few studies however, have addressed species harvested for multiple parts or investigated how spatial variation affects harvest patterns and their impacts. We documented rates and patterns of pruning and debarking and their impacts on density and population structure, for 12 populations of the multiuse tree, Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae) in two ecological regions (Sudano-Guinean versus Sudanian) of Benin, West Africa. Half of the populations had low or no harvest and half were highly harvested. Patterns of pruning and debarking were size-specific, with harvesters tending to prefer larger trees. Foliage harvest pressures were very high across both regions, with >70% of trees harvested for 100% of their crowns. A significantly greater proportion of trees were harvested for foliage in the wetter Sudano-Guinean region than in Sudanian region. The reverse was true for the proportion of foliage and bark-harvested per tree. In the Sudano-Guinean region, high harvest populations had significantly lower densities of seedlings and saplings than low harvest populations. The size-class distribution coefficient of skewness was significantly correlated with rainfall, habitat, and soil type. Variation in harvesting patterns and their ecological impacts can be explained in large part by differences in water availability between the two regions. Effective conservation plans for K. senegalensis require close consideration of the environmental and land-use context in which populations occur. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many NTFP are harvested from disturbed habitats and therefore subject to multiple pressures, few quantitative studies have addressed this issue. Similarly few NTFP studies have assessed seasonal variation in demographic rates even though this can confound harvest effects. In Hawai'i, the wild-gathered ferns, Microlepia strigosa and Sphenomeris chinensis, represent highly important cultural resources but declining populations have led to conservation concerns. Both ferns are harvested from disturbed, alien-dominated forests and contemporary Hawaiian gathering practices often consist of harvest and concurrent weeding of alien invasive species. We assessed the effects of concurrent frond-harvest and alien species weeding on frond structure, density, and rates of production by comparing experimentally harvested vs. control plots, and documented relationships between frond demographic patterns and precipitation. Gathering practices had no impact on frond density of either species or on most other demographic parameters over the short term. Exceptions included a significant decrease in the density of the longest S. chinensis fronds and a significant decrease in M. strigosa frond production when fronds were gathered without alien weeding. However, seasonal and annual changes in frond density and production occurred across all plots of both species and were significantly correlated with precipitation. The relatively low harvest effects for both species are likely due to several factors including short frond longevity and the strict criteria used by gatherers to select harvestable fronds. The potential for sustainable harvest in the context of alien-dominated forests is discussed. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Demography; Ferns; Hawai'i; Invasive species; Microlepia strigosa; Non-timber forest products; Sphenomeris chinensis; Sustainable harvest","demography; fern; harvesting; nontimber forest product; population decline; rainfall; seasonal variation; Hawaii [United States]; North America; United States; Filicophyta; Microlepia strigosa; Sphenomeris chinensis","Ticktin, T.; Botany Department, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, United States; email: Ticktin@hawaii.edu",,,09603115,,BONSE,,"English","Biodiversity Conserv.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249679796

Its tenuous rhizome, known as ""Yunnan goldthread"" in the traditional Chinese medicine system, has been used as an antibacterial and as an anti-inflammatory medicine for a long time. The increasing demand has resulted in commercial harvesting pressure on wild populations that were already dwindling as a result of deforestation, and wild populations are at risk of extinction. Fortunately, there exists at least 2000 hectares of a C. teete-based agroforestry system initiated by the Lisu people in Nujiang, northwest Yunnan. This cultivation supplies us with a valuable study case for the balance between conservation and sustainable use. This case study investigated the traditional management system and history of C. teeta in Nujiang through ethnobotanical methods and field investigation. We also contrasted initial costs, economic returns, and labor demands for C. teeta cultivation with other major land uses in the region. Compared with swidden agriculture, the major land-use type in the region, C. teeta cultivation offers high economic returns and low labor and initial costs; moreover, C. teeta cultivation does not interfere with subsistence agricultural duties. This agroforestry system reflected that the cultivation of NTFPs is a conservation strategy for maintaining forest diversity, while providing a stable economic return to local forest communities, and indicates how local people manage biodiversity effectively. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2007.",,"agroforestry; anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; conservation planning; cost-benefit analysis; cultivation; economic diversification; ethnobotany; evergreen tree; exploitation; extinction risk; local participation; nontimber forest product; shifting cultivation; traditional medicine; wild population; article; China; Coptis; economics; ecosystem; environmental protection; forestry; growth, development and aging; legal aspect; methodology; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coptis; Ecosystem; Forestry; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Nujiang River; Yunnan; Coptis; Coptis teeta; Ranunculaceae","Huang, J.; Kunming Institute of Botany, , Kunming, Yunnan, 650204, China; email: huangji@mail.kib.ac.cn",,,00447447,,AMBOC,"17626473","English","Ambio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547127371

The blanket nature of these impositions when combined with rapid socio-economic changes have increased pressures on many small rural communities. In this paper, we examine the case of Jisha Village in northwestern Yunnan, China-a typical rural Tibetan community sustained by traditional agriculture and livestock management. The cessation of commercial logging has seen the community turn to towards other income streams such as non-timber forest products (NTFP), increased livestock and attempts to foster tourism. However, timber quotas together with new road access have spurred the development of unofficial markets for village firewood and enhanced access to nearby forests. In addition, the decline of bamboo-a traditional fencing material-has resulted in an estimated 35-fold increase in demand for pine wood. Wood demands in this community are swiftly exceeding the sustainable harvest levels. Forest loss does not merely represent the depletion or degradation of future village timber resources, but also the loss of NTFP habitat. Moreover, due to proscriptions on rangeland burning, pasturelands are becoming degraded and grazing in forests is more intensive-reducing forest regeneration. These findings support calls to improve the flexibility and incorporate local needs into forest policy-the problems highlighted here seem indicative of the practical and philosophical challenges facing environmental planning and research in China. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Community forest; Firewood collection; Logging ban; Non-timber forest products; Northwest Yunnan; Pinus densata; Tibetan villagers","burning; conservation management; environmental planning; environmental research; forestry policy; resource use; rural area; village; wood; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jisha; Xizang; Yunnan; Pinus densata","Melick, D.; Department of Biogeography and Ecology, , Heilongtan, Kunming, Yunnan 650204, China; email: dmelick@mail.kib.ac.cn",,,09603115,,BONSE,,"English","Biodiversity Conserv.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249739773

Yet millions of kilograms of mosses, liverworts, some lichens and an occasional vascular plant are harvested from the forests of the Pacific Northwest of North America each year without an adequate understanding of which species are impacted by harvest. Research has focused on epiphytic bryophytes as the primary target of harvest, but the habitats and substrates actually impacted by harvest and the species sold as ""moss"" have never been determined. To determine if the species being researched are the same as those that are actually sold, we compared the relative abundance and species composition of 17 commercially sold bags of moss with those from 33 field sites in the Oregon Coast and Cascade Ranges on which moss harvest research had previously been conducted. Most species found in the purchased bags had been previously reported from the field studies of what were thought to be commercially harvestable species, including all of the most frequently harvested taxa.

Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L) were grown in the winters and mungbean (Vigna radiata) and maize in the summers. Immediately after grain harvest, above-ground residues of all crops were either completely removed (-residue), or spread across the plots and incorporated by chisel plough by disc harrow and rotavator (+residue). Fertlizer N rates were nil or 120 kg ha-1 for wheat and nil or 160 kg ha-1 for maize. Our results indicated that post-harvest incorporation of crop residues significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the grain and stover yields of maize during both 2000 and 2001. On average, grain yield was increased by 23.7% and stover yield by 26.7% due to residue incorporation. Residue retention also enhanced N uptake by 28.3% in grain and 45.1% in stover of maize. The soil N fertility was improved by 29.2% due to residue retention. The maize grain and stover yields also responded significantly to the previous legume (chickpea) compared with the previous cereal (wheat) treatment. The legume treatment boosted grain yield of maize by 112% and stover yield by 133% with 64.4% increase in soil N fertility. Similarly, fertilizer N applied to previous wheat showed considerable carry over effect on grain (8.9%) and stover (40.7%) yields of the following maize. Application of fertilizer N to current maize substantially increased grain yield of maize by 110%, stover yield by 167% and soil N fertility by 9.8% over the nil N fertilizer treatment. We concluded from these experiments that returning of crop residues, application of fertilizer N and involvement of legumes in crop rotation greatly improves the N economy of the cropping systems and enhances crop productivity through additional N and other benefits in low N soils. The farmers who traditionally remove residues for fodder and fuel will require demonstration of the relative benefits of residues return to soil for sustainable crop productivity. © 2006.","C; Crop residues; Cropping systems; Maize; N","Fertilizers; Harvesting; Soils; Crop residues; Cropping systems; Fodder and fuel; Grain yield; Crops; aboveground biomass; crop production; crop rotation; crop yield; experimental study; fertilizer application; legume; maize; nutrient dynamics; soil fertility; soil nutrient; Corn; Crop Rotation; Fertilizers; Harvesting; Soil; Animalia; Cicer arietinum; Triticum aestivum; Vigna radiata; Vigna radiata var. radiata; Zea; Zea mays","Bakht, J.; Department of Agronomy, Pakistan; email: jehanbakht@yahoo.co.uk",,,01671987,,SOTRD,,"English","Soil Tillage Res.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248208047

This paper analyses the causes of deforestation of the deciduous broadleaved forests on the slopes of the Talysh Mountains in Southern Azerbaijan. The Caspian forests in Azerbaijan, though officially under protection, have suffered from different forms of degradation since the collapse of the Soviet Union (SU) in the early 1990's. The breakdown of the kolkhozes as major employer, an energy shortage in rural areas, and a lack of enforcement of forest laws aggravated the situation. We interviewed members of the local communities in Gegiran and Tujadu, two isolated mountain villages in the study region, and forest officials during September and October 2006. The majority of the population in both villages is Talysh ethnics with occasional intermarriage from outside. Both villages have access to the coastal plains with dirt roads, which often become impassable during periods of heavy rain. Electric power is temporarily available in both villages but gas supply is lacking. Apart from electricity fuel wood is the main source of energy. The average income and living costs are low. People support themselves with illegal timber extraction, make a living as foreign workers, mainly in Russia, or are employed in the public sector. Additionally, villagers produce non-timber forest products (NTFP) and carry out subsistence agriculture. The villagers extract more than 30,000 m3 of wood annually with a value of about 0.5 million New Azerbaijan Manat (AZN). The volume and value of timber and fuel wood for commercial purposes exceed the wood utilization for domestic use. The production of lumber in Gegiran yields the highest profit but the timber volume of fuel wood exceeds that of lumber for several times. Aside from wood products, silvopasture is the next profitable forest utilization. The forests are government-owned and commercial logging is banned. Low enforcement of the regulations creates a situation of open access for timber extraction. The high profitability and the absence of income alternatives increase the pressure on forest resources. Forest areas are rarely converted into arable land because agricultural production is not profitable under current conditions. There is evidence that the degradation of forests causes increased erosion, flood risk, a strong decline in timber stands and affects the meso-climate. The absence of institutions such as property rights and enforcement of these rights seems to be the major cause for deforestation, followed by the lack of income alternatives. We suggest granting property rights to local resource user groups or individuals. The local communities and the forest authorities can use the forests in a process of adaptive comanagement in order to decrease deforestation and maximize the benefits from forest utilization. Gas might represent a future substitute for fuel wood. Creating income alternatives will be the greatest future challenge for the region.","Azerbaijan; Caspian forest; Forest degradation; Institutions; Non-timber products; Political transition; Timber","broad-leaved forest; deciduous forest; deforestation; economic analysis; exploitation; nontimber forest product; Asia; Azerbaijan; Eurasia; Gegiran; Talysh Mountains; Tujadu; West Asia","Noack, F.; Institute of Botany und Landscape Ecology, Grimmer Straße 88, D -17487 Greifswald, Germany; email: frederik.noack@gmx.de",,,00039306,,ANCHE,,"English","Archiv.

In this paper, we examine the structure of natural forests and its impact on regeneration, growth and yield of palmiteiro in the Mata Atlântica region. Flowering and seed production of mature palmiteiros are variable but approximately one-half of all 'seed-bearing' palmiteiros flower and produce seed in any given year. Our results suggest that as the density or abundance of other woody plants increases, regeneration, survival and growth of palmiteiro is usually reduced. High densities of palmiteiro itself appear to suppress growth, while harvesting of mature palmiteiro leads to a marked increase in the growth of smaller size classes of palms. A reduction in the density or abundance of trees, lianas and tree-ferns would appear to benefit palmiteiro, but the differences in forest structure between the study sites suggests that successful management strategies may differ depending upon site conditions. A native bamboo (Guadua tagoara) limits the regeneration of many woody plants, but it appears to have only a limited effect on the survival, regeneration and growth of palmiteiro. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In 1996 the Asian Development Bank funded the Forestry Sector Project (FSP) in NWFP, which has institutionalized the participatory forest management system in the province. Forests are important natural capital and an essential part of the daily lives of the people who live in and around them. It was therefore considered imperative to analyze the impact of the participatory forest management model introduced by the FSP through a livelihoods lens, and to assess the contribution to livelihood sustainability made by the participatory approach. The findings of the study may be applied to similar situations in Third World settings. People of similar socio-economic and ecological zones may learn lessons for accelerating the process of sustainable natural resource management in their areas. The results showed that the participatory forest management system introduced by the FSP has had a definite impact on increasing the natural and social assets of forest dwellers and reducing vulnerability to their livelihoods. But the project did not address most of the factors of vulnerability and the elites that dominated the newly created institutions. It is suggested that the available livelihood assets, diverse factors of vulnerability and livelihood strategies of the local communities should be analyzed before the implementation of such mega-projects. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Livelihoods; Participation; Sustainable forest management; Vulnerability","coping strategy; deforestation; forest management; institutional reform; natural capital; participatory approach; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; vulnerability; Asia; Eurasia; North-West Frontier; Pakistan; South Asia","Shahbaz, B.; Department of Agricultural Extension, Pakistan; email: bsuaf@yahoo.com",,,13504509,,,,"English","Int.

Chamaedorea harvesting contributes to forest livelihoods in several regions of Mexico, the Petén region of Guatemala, and Belize. Such commercialization of NTFPs has long been advocated (as well as debated) as a means to integrate forest conservation and rural development objectives. Yet, extractive production system models and experience suggest that system dynamics are not sufficiently stable over time and space to reconcile these objectives. This paper considers NTFP certification as an intervention to promote the long-term reconciliation of integrated conservation and development objectives in a working forest context. Specifically, we consider palm harvesting in the community forest concessions of the Maya Biosphere Reserve in order to address the fundamental question: how might certification ensure that NTFP extraction remains an ecologically sustainable and economically viable source of income for communities in working forests?

However the total hourly-recorded available precipitation data for different parts of NWFP from different departments have been collected and analyzed for the present study. The data from WAPDA is found to be more authentic. Making use of the data, functions of intensity-duration- frequency for precipitation are developed for the Bannu region, representing the lower hilly and plane areas in NWFP. The IDF curves are plotted for 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100-year return periods. The theoretical intensities of precipitation calculated by the developed functions are in close agreement with those recorded at the stations through automatic gages. Only 7 % variation is observed for most of the time. The values of the constants k, b and exponents n, m in the IDF function are calculated from the observed precipitation data. The correctness of the developed function is ascertained through its comparison with existing equations for depth duration developed for the world's largest rainfall events. The function developed is found to produce more realistic results for regions in NWFP. The developed function may be used in the same region in a radius of about 100 km.

Aims: To measure depressive symptoms and associated features in a population-based sample. Method: A Pushto translation of the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ) was administered to 471 adults living in a village in one of the federally administered tribal areas. Respondents were also assessed with a life events checklist for social problems, a social support questionnaire and the Brief Disability Questionnaire. Results: Sixty per cent (95/158) of women and 45% (140/313) of men scored 9 or more on the SRQ. High SRQ score was associated with few years of education, higher social problem score, less social support and greater disability. High social problem score was the strongest correlate. Conclusions: This population reports more depressive symptoms than other communities in Pakistan and this probably reflects the very high degree of social stress experienced in the NWFP, which has been affected by years of turmoil in neighbouring Afghanistan.",,"adult; article; clinical feature; controlled study; depression; ethnic group; female; human; life stress; major clinical study; male; Pakistan; population research; questionnaire; scoring system; self report; sex difference; social problem; social support; Adolescent; Adult; Afghanistan; Depressive Disorder; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Pakistan; Prevalence; Refugees; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological","Husain, N.; Division of Psychiatry, Oxford Road, Manchester MI3 9WL, United Kingdom; email: nusrat.husain@manchester.ac.uk",,,00071250,,BJPYA,"17197654","English","Br.

Box 80084, 3508 TB Utrecht, Netherlands","Harvesting nontimber forest products (NTFPs) is a major economic activity in tropical forests. As many NTFPs are overexploited, sustainability analyses are required to set harvest guidelines. Here we introduce and apply a new approach to evaluating sustainability, which combines prospective (elasticity) and retrospective (Life Table Response Experiments [LTRE]) demographic analyses of matrix population models. We relate the elasticity of vital rates (representing their importance for population growth rate, λ) to their contribution to harvest-induced change in λ (""LTRE contribution""). When high-elasticity vital rates have a low LTRE contribution, exploitation is potentially sustainable as negative effects for population growth are buffered. If the reverse is found, there is little scope for sustainability because crucial vital rates are affected. Our approach is less sensitive to chance fluctuations than the commonly used sustainability criterion of λ = 1.0, as it does not depend on the absolute value of λ. We applied this analysis to Geonoma deversa, a clustered forest understory palm. We studied three experimentally defoliated and control populations in a Bolivian rainforest during two years. Cutting all leaves of large ramets did not change mortality but strongly affected growth and reproduction. In spite of severe changes in some vital rates, population growth rate was not significantly reduced after defoliation. A literature review revealed that six other understory palms species responded very similarly to defoliation. The combination of LTRE contributions and elasticity analyses showed that low-elasticity vital rates were mainly responsible for the defoliation-induced change in λ for Geonoma deversa. For two other understory palms (Astrocaryum mexicanum and Chamaedorea radicalis) new demographic analyses yielded very similar results. For Geonoma, the LTRE contribution-elasticity relation strongly changed when we mimicked harvest damage. Adding 5% mortality to defoliated palms caused stronger change in λ, mainly due to changes in a high-elasticity vital rate (survival). Therefore, harvest practices that involve stem killing are clearly unsustainable. Our results show that commercial leaf cutting in Geonoma deversa is potentially sustainable, and that this is likely the case for understory palms in general. Our approach to evaluating harvest sustainability can be applied to other NTFPs. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bolivia; Defoliation; Demography; Elasticity analysis; Geonoma deversa; Life Table Response Experiments (LTRE); Nontimber forest products (NTFP); Population matrix models; Sustainability, tropical forest","defoliation; evergreen tree; growth rate; harvesting; integrated approach; leaf; mortality; nontimber forest product; population modeling; sustainability; tropical forest; Arecaceae; article; growth, development and aging; plant leaf; prospective study; retrospective study; Arecaceae; Plant Leaves; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Bolivia; South America; Astrocaryum mexicanum; Chamaedorea radicalis; Geonoma; Geonoma deversa","Zuidema, P.A.; Section of Plant Ecology and Biodiversity, P.O.

Laboratory and field tests were conducted during 2003 and 2004 in NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, Pakistan, to investigate the suitability of various Laboratory vigor tests, to rank quality of commercial seed lots and to predict seedling Field Emergence (FE) of thirty-two samples of four wheat varieties. Seeds of four wheat cultivars Takbeer 2000, Haider 2000, Bakhtawar-92 and Fakhri Sarhad were produced in eight different location of NWFP-Pakistan during 2003 and 2004. Mature seeds were harvested, threshed and cleaned before determining standard germination and other vigor tests. Results showed that among all tests, Germination Index (GI), Accelerated Aging (AA) and Electrical Conductivity (EC) provided the best estimate of seed vigor for the four wheat cultivars, both for ranking seed lots quality and predicting field emergence. The GI, AA and EC tests better indicated seed lot quality and predicted FE than SG of the four cultivars over the 2 years followed by Radical Length (RL). The Electrical Conductivity (EC) result was not only poorly related to FE, but also poorly related to the Standard Germination (SG) of a wide range of seed lots of the four varieties that varied in viability. Initial count of Standard Germination (SGi) generally performed more poorly than the other vigor tests. From this study and previous work on wheat crop, we conclude that GI, AA and EC test for wheat crop have the potential to be developed as improved vigor tests for ranking seed lot quality and predicting seeding performance under temperate regions of the world. © 2007 Academic Journals Inc.","Environment; Germination; Seed quality; Temperate; Vigor; Wheat cultivars","Triticum aestivum","Khan, A.Z.; Department of Agronomy, , Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Science Publications",15574539,,,,"English","Am.

Handicrafts provide about US$1,800/year per artisan, being especially important to women. Experimental scape harvesting in mid-October, which is when knowledgeable artisans harvest and when the seeds are mature, had no consistent effects on population density, plant survival, or reproduction (clonal or sexual) after one year. Since 40% of the new recruits come from seeds, harvest after seed maturation, combined with removal of only the scapes and not the flowerheads, can allow for S. nitens seeds to remain in the populations and help ensure sustainability of the growing S. nitens handicraft activity.

In Pakistan, northwestern frontier province (NWFP) and Northern Punjab are the loquat growing provinces and its fruit comes in the market when no other fresh fruit is available. Most of the loquat orchards have been established through the plants grown by seeds, hence having variation in various characters. So the loquat growers face difficulties during grading and marketing. There are no identified loquat cultivars available to the growers for uniform orchard plantation in the loquat growing belts of Pakistan. So there is a great need to characterize the available loquat genotypes of Pakistan. For this purpose, nine sites from the main loquat growing areas of Pakistan (Tret, Chhattar, Rawalpindi, Hasan Abdal, Wah, Hari Pur, Mardan, Kalar Kahar and Choa Saiden Shah) were selected and plants of different genotypes being grown over there were marked for the detailed study regarding different morpho-physical traits. Nineteen genotypes locally found in these areas were characterized on the basis of various characters. Average fruit weight of different genotypes ranged from 10.1 g to 39.7 g. Range of average fruit length was from 2.68 cm to 5.10 cm while that of width was from 2.60 cm to 3.87 cm. Fruit width/length idex ranged from 0.76 to 1.06. Average fruit density was between 1.014 g/cc and 1.097 g/cc. Percentage of edible portion ranged from 74.11 to 86.59.

This study was conducted with the objective of identifying the existence of malignant GI tumors in the young population of Pakistan and to determine high risk geographical areas of the country. Methodology: Pediatric and adolescence (≤14 years; ≤19 years) gastrointestinal malignancies, ICD-10 categories C15-20 registered at the surgical pathology department of the Aga Khan University Hospital during 1st March 2004 to 30th April 2006 were included in the cross-sectional study. Results:Sixty cases in =19 year age group were studied. The mean age was 16.2 years (SD±4.56). Carcinoma comprised 47 cases (78.3%; 32 boys and 15 girls.) and lymphoma 13 cases (21.7%; 12 boys and 1 girl). All cases presented as advanced malignancies. Categorization of carcinoma by site was colon (85.1%), stomach (6.4%) and esophagus (8.5%). Lymphoid malignancies were diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (30.8%), Burkitt lymphoma (46.1%) and Burkittlike lymphoma (23.1%). The mean age at presentation was 11.1 years (SD± 4.6). Conclusion: This study has identified a substantial number of GI malignancies in the ≤19 year Pakistani population, involvement of esophagus, male predominance, preponderance of carcinoma versus lymphoma and a high signet ring cell and mucinous colo-rectal carcinoma. It has identified Baluchistan as a high risk region for esophageal cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and NWFP for Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphoma. Most findings in the present study did not concur with published western data, indicating the need to study cancer in the Asian population.","Adolescence; Childhood; Gastrointestinal malignancies; Karachi; Pakistan; Pediatric","adolescent; adult; article; child; cross-sectional study; female; gastrointestinal tumor; human; infant; male; newborn; Pakistan; pathology; preschool child; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pakistan; Young Adult","Bhurgri, Y.; Pathology and Microbiology Department, Stadium Road, P.O.

This research assessed the extraction of plant products from two montane forest ecosystems, Uzungwa Scarp Forest Reserve (USFR) and Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), East Africa. In USFR, data from vegetation sampling and interviews with local people were used to understand the ecological and socio-economic aspects of non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting. The densities of eight commonly harvested tree species, most of which were used as building poles, were approximately 2.4-4.5 times lower in disturbed versus undisturbed habitats across all four sites in USFR. Interviews with 91 women and 54 men suggested that most species were harvested for medicinal uses (57 species) and building purposes (50 species). In BINP, the liana Loeseneriella apocynoides (Apocynaceae), is harvested for basketry weaving. Evidence suggested that the liana was harvested in both protected and unprotected areas of BINP. Data collected suggested a negative impact on this species in an unprotected versus a protected area, with stem diameters larger than 1 cm significantly more abundant in the protected area. This study reveals that harvesting of NTFPs occurs even in these two protected forest areas, and that over-exploitation not only threatens species of high-demand, but could also alter forest structure and composition. Management practices that encourage the monitoring of sustainable harvesting levels of species and promote alternative plants for the same uses should be considered as part of conservation strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, they have not enjoyed the attention from scientists during their exploration of forests. Nevertheless, they offer a formidable horticultural value that has to be exploited to the benefit of humankind. The Cameroon Rainforest is part of the Congo Basin and ranked by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) as one of the world biodiversity hot spots. The Southwest (SW) region of this country has the Mount Cameroon range with diverse forest types and full of endemism and new species of plants. The attribution of value to ornamental plants of the forest will give more weight to its conservation and sustainable use. Impatiens L. and Begonia L., the two most popular flowers in the world were studied. These taxa are pandemic in natural distribution and they are present in SW Cameroon in glacial rainforest refuges in massifs that survived the last global glaciations. These massifs have very ancient relatives of these taxa still in existence and other unique species. These wild species could be of tremendous importance for horticultural plant improvement, and the introduction and creation of new crops. The current germplasm collection and conservation of these genera in Cameroon is minimal. Some of the key species in this region include in particular Impatiens mannii, I. niamniamensis, I. macroptera, I. hains, I. filicornu, I. burtonii, I. palpebrata, I. sakerana. Species such as I. grandisepala Grey-Wilson is strictly endemic to Mount Cameroon and a new species, and another new species is endemic to Mount Etinde. Some key Begonia species are B. oxyanthera, B. preussii and B. ampla. The B. quadrialata subsp. dusenii (Warb) Sosef is an endemic rare Begonia species to the SW slope of Mount Cameroon.

Changes in seed quality (Viability and Germination) were monitored from developmental to maturation (growth stage R5 to R7) of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in different planting dates. Information on the effect of planting date on seed fresh and dry weight, moisture content and germination of soybean is meager. A field experiment was conducted with four planting dates and two soybean cultivars to study the influence of planting dates on seed developmental traits for 2 years. Determinate cultivars (Epps, maturity group [MG] V) and indeterminate cultivar, Williams 82 [MG] 111) were planted on May 1st to August 1st at one month interval at the Agriculture Research Farm of the NWFP Agricultural University Peshawar, during 2000 and 2001. Seeds were harvested at 10-days interval from 35 to 75 days after anthesis (DAA) in all planting dates. Epps planted in early May gave maximum fresh dry seed weight and moisture content. A steady decrease in fresh and dry weight and moisture content were observed with delay in sowing of soybean. An inverse relationship was noted in Williams 82 regarding fresh, dry weight and moisture content in all planting dates. Water per seed increased up to 100% DAA, after which no further increase occurred. Moisture content declined for the whole seed, respectively, from above 75 and 65% at 95 DAA to 65 and 50% at 140 DAA in both cultivars. Decrease in seed moisture content during development was accompanied by increase in desiccation tolerance and germination, reaching maximum at physiological maturity in both cultivars. Fresh and dry seed germination increased linearly in both varieties. Mean rate of change in germination was more pronounce in Epps as compared to Williams 82. Immature seeds in both cultivars during early developmental stage did not germinate in all planting dates. © 2007 Academic Journals Inc.","Attributes; Planting dates; Seed development; Soybean varieties","Glycine max","Khan, A.Z.; Department of Agronomy, , Peshawar, Pakistan",,"Science Publications",15574539,,,,"English","Am.

It has been found that this weed can grow in association of many other plants of which Cannabis sativa is more important but further studies indicated that even Cannabis is replaced by this weed which means it is highly tolerant and hardy in its nature and due to absence of some natural enemy (Predate) it tends to grow on unprecented rate. During the present study it has been observed that Parthenium can grow in variety of soil types with different pH values. Mostly sandy loam and sandy clay loam are found highly conductive for its growth. It is nature of its wide adaptability of various soil types due to which it is found replacing the Cannabis and other natural flora. However, well grown Cannabis plants compete for survival with this weed. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Allelopathy; Cannabis sativa L.; Parthenium hysterophorus; Soil","Cannabis; Cannabis sativa; Parthenium; Parthenium hysterophorus","Qureshi, R.A.; Department of Plant Sciences, , Islamabad, Pakistan",,,10288880,,,,"English","Pak.

Two maize populations, one developed through recurrent selection (DRS) and the other through mass selection (DMS), each comprising of 125 S 1 families were tested in modified Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with two replications. Six fodder related traits viz., plant height, internode length, stem girth, flag leaf area, dry matter content and fresh fodder yield were determined. Mean squares from the analysis of variance among S 1 families for both maize populations indicated highly significant (p≤0.01) differences for all the parameters. Data ranged from 58.7-201.9 and 60.8-184.1 cm for plant height, 6.6-16.3 to 13.0-18.5 cm for internode length, 0.7-2.0 to 0.7-1.6 cm for stem girth, 9.7-177.2 to 9.0-120.0 for flag leaf area, 124.0-680.0 to 182.0-652.0 g kg -1 for dry matter content and 600.0-6720.0 to 360.0-5040.0 kg ha -1 for fresh fodder yield in DRS and DMS population, respectively.

The proposal of the recombinant NFM-12-12 was submitted for approval as commercial variety for NWFP to the Provincial Seed Council meeting held on 19th September 2005 at NWFP Agricultural University, Peshawar. The Provincial Seed Council approved the recombinant NFM12-12 as a commercial variety under the name ""Ramzan"" for general cultivation in NWFP. The major improvement in NFM-12-12 is manifested in the form of increase in seed size, decrease in plant height, stiff stem and earliness in maturity by a margin of 10 days as compared to standard variety NM 98. The large seed size of NFM-12-12 is the main contributing factor towards the increase in seed yield compared to NM 98. The high harvest index of NFM-12-12 invokes its greater physiological efficiency in partitioning the photosynthates towards grain formation leading to marked increase in grain yield. Short stature and stiff stem of NFM-12-12 helps in showing resistance to lodging. Clusters per plant, pods per plant, branches per plant, pod length, seeds per pod and protein contents of NFM-12-12 also compare favorably with parent NM 92 and standard NM 98.

My research will consider its potential role in the future viability of palm (Chamaedorea spp) harvest in the community forest concessions of the Maya Biosphere Reserve, where NTFP extraction generates income and, ostensibly, provides communities with an incentive to protect the forest. The current transition from extractivism to cultivated production harbingers a loss of forest product income for forest communities and a disruption of the livelihood systems that are the foundation for conservation. The issue is not whether Chamaedorea will remain an economically important commodity globally, as production practices shift, but whether extraction will remain a viable income-generating strategy for community forest concessions. The palm production system will be analyzed at three scales: the global commodity chain, the forest management unit, and the household. A productionto-consumption system analysis will be used to identify opportunities and constraints of the extractive production system. Ethnographic linear programming will be used to assess community and household level adaptability to a dynamic production environment. Certification as a mechanism for the integration of conservation and development objectives will depend on the viability of extractivism at all three scales, and on the identification of policy and market levers that can retain the system's comparative advantage. This multi-scale analysis represents a first step toward identifying the requisite standards of such a certification. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

We used empirically derived landscape suitability models for the spotted owl and the fisher to evaluate the overlap in habitat suitability for these two old forest-associated predators in an area of northern California affected by the Northwest Forest Plan (NWFP), a bioregional conservation plan. The area includes designated Wilderness areas and new reserves (Late-Successional Reserves, LSRs) established under the NWFP. We used the site selection algorithm MARXAN to identify priority habitat areas for each species, and for both combined, and to compare these areas with reserves. Sites were selected under two constraints, to achieve a threshold proportion of total habitat value and to select new areas equal to the total current area in existing reserves. The rank correlation between predicted value for the two species was low (0.11), because areas of highest predicted habitat value were more widely distributed for the owl. This difference also meant that the sites selected to optimize habitat value were more aggregated for fishers than owls, resulting in greater overlap of owl habitat and current reserves. To capture 25%, 50% and 75% of total habitat value for the owl required 14.0%, 29.2%, and 47.3% of the planning units, respectively; capturing the same for the fisher required only 5.3%, 13.5%, and 27.2%. A combined owl-fisher scenario resulted in areas that overlapped only ∼50% of existing reserves. The current location of LSRs may not be the best solution to maintaining well-connected habitats for these area-limited species in northwestern California. Whether LSRs are a better solution to protecting the diversity of other lesser-known taxa (i.e., salamanders and mollusks) is the subject of related work. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Material And Methods: This retrospective, analytic study was conducted from 1998-2004, and included all the pregnant patients including miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies, presenting during this period to Gynae B Unit, Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar. The records of maternal deaths were reviewed from 1998- 2004 retrospectively and causes of direct deaths were analyzed. Deaths in non-pregnant patients and indirect deaths in pregnant patients were excluded. Results: Total number of live births during the time period was 23720 and total number of maternal deaths was 311. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was calculated as 1311/100,000 live births. Out of 311 maternal deaths, 268 (86.2%) had direct causes and 43 (13.8%) had indirect causes of maternal mortality. Haemorrhage was responsible for 42.16% (113/268) of maternal deaths, followed by hypertensive disorders in 24.63% (66/268), ruptured uterus in 10.45% (28/268), septicemia in 9.7% (26/268), thrombo-embolism in 7.8% (21/268) and unsafe abortion in 3.4% (9/268) cases. Conclusion: The study shows a very high MMR as compared to national figures. The leading cause of direct maternal death was hemorrhage, followed by pregnancy induced hypertension, ruptured uterus and septicemia.

RS/GIS analysis can show where water enters a system and how it leaves through evapotranspiration and runoff. Using this information, planners can identify areas where there is potential for development of new water resources; where water can be reallocated from one use or one basin to another; and identify potential areas of water scarcity before water shortages occur. The main objective of this research is to calculate accurate crop water requirement by using RS/GIS in combination with hydraulic models. The results helped in devising guidelines, which in turn will help the policy makers to release the water supplies based on crop requirement only rather than supply based. Multi temporal satellite images were used to identify various crops and cropping pattern in the area. This study was conducted for the Pehure High Level Canal (PHLC) and the Upper Swat Canal (USC) system in the North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. Crop identification at distributary level was made from multi-temporal Remote Sensing satellite images. Various image processing techniques such as supervised, unsupervised classification and spectral mixture analysis were used to correctly identify various types of crops in the region and ultimately accurate areas of all the classified crops was calculated from the satellite images. These calculated areas were compared with the seasonal data recorded by the irrigation department. ET was calculated using CROPWA T model at various stages of crop growth. Then water required for each individual crop was calculated. The results are very encouraging. The results of this study can be used while devising guidelines for water managers to release the canal supplies based on crop water requirement.

The commercial collection of these products could reduce both the number of species and population of a species in the forests. In order to keep the balance between biodiversity and commercial collection of NTFPs, this paper evaluates the dependence of forest dwellers on NTFPs and identifies the relation between household characteristics and cash income generated by NTFP collection. As a result, commercial collection of NTFPs is negatively correlated to dependency ratio, poverty level and distance to the provincial city, and positively correlated with female labors of households. Moreover, NTFPs are proved to be very important in poor households or in those who lack rice or high rate of female labor. The households who have higher dependency ratio benefit less from NTFPs sold, while those who lack rice for their own consumption or have a higher rate of female labor depend more on NTFPs. Poor households are more dependent on NTFP collection than other groups. Finally, the result of this study highly recommends that the Government of Vietnam be aware of gender balance, distance to provincial city, poverty level and dependency ratio when applying a policy related to NTFP conservation. An appropriate incentive policy for woman and poor households might be a possible solution for less commercial collection of NTFPs. The poor households who have low dependency ratio or high female labor rate should be encouraged to participate in the forest management system to control the balance between commercial collection of NTFP and conservation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

There is increasing concern that the planting stocks of Dyera polyphylla and Aquilaria filaria are not sufficient to sustain the yield of NTFPs and promote forest conservation. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of two arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, Glomus clarum and Gigaspora decipiens, on the early growth of two NTFP species, D. polyphylla and A. filaria, under greenhouse conditions. The seedlings of both species were inoculated with G. clarum or G. decipiens, or uninoculated (control) under greenhouse conditions. Percentage of AM colonization, plant growth, survival rate, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations were measured after 180 days of growth. The percentage of AM colonization of D. polyphylla and A. filaria ranged from 87 to 93% and from 22 to 39%, respectively. Colonization by G. clarum and G. decipiens increased plant height, diameter, and shoot and root dry weights. Shoot N and P concentrations of the seedlings were increased by AM colonization by as much as 70-153% and 135-360%, respectively. Survival rates were higher in the AM-colonized seedlings at 180 days after transplantation than in the control seedlings. The results suggest that AM fungi can accelerate the establishment of the planting stocks of D. polyphylla and A. filaria, thereby promoting their conservation ecologically and sustaining the production of these NTFPs economically. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","AM fungi; Aquilaria filaria; Dyera polyphylla; NTFP; Rehabilitation; Tropical forest","arbuscular mycorrhiza; colonization; conservation; endangered species; exploitation; greenhouse ecosystem; growth rate; inoculation; nontimber forest product; seedling; tree; Apocynaceae; article; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; microclimate; mycorrhiza; physiology; plant; plant root; Thymelaeaceae; tree; Apocynaceae; Environment, Controlled; Mycorrhizae; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Thymelaeaceae; Trees; Aquilaria filaria; Arbuscular; Dyera; Filaria; Fungi; Gigaspora decipiens; Glomus clarum","Tawaraya, K.; Faculty of Agriculture, , Tsuruoka 997-8555, Japan; email: tawaraya@tds1.tr.yamagata-u.ac.jp",,,09406360,,MCORE,"16758200","English","Mycorrhiza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748586802

This paper places the market for NTFPs in the emerging literature on value chains which has, so far, lacked a detailed analysis of NTFPs. Our analysis reveals that certain key entrepreneurs are a driving force of success throughout several NTFP value chains in both Bolivia and Mexico. Where market information is scarce, e.g. where producers are distant from consumers, key entrepreneurs often govern entire value chains. We argue that certain entrepreneurs are key to spreading success throughout the value chains of selected NTFPs offsetting potential negative consequences such as exploitation of more upstream actors (e.g. collectors and processors) in the value chains. Typical examples include the shopkeeper/organisation in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, who sources woven palm products from and supports several producers, and the entrepreneur in Mexico who established links between mushroom pickers in rural communities and brokers and consumers in Japan. Rather than criticising the monopolistic position of individuals, it is important to understand how the activity of key entrepreneurs can be supported in spreading successful commercialisation further and where necessary control negative impacts of their role. Our analysis indicates that policies to support commercialisation of the case study NTFPs would also need to be tailored to each value chain. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Ecological impacts of harvest are unknown in most cases, despite interest in NTFP for sustainable development and concerns over over-exploitation. Moreover, most studies are ≤2 years in duration, so may not capture long-term harvest impacts or reveal sustainable harvest levels, especially for long-lived species or when impacts are likely to be cumulative. We examined the effects of several leaf harvest regimes on the demography of the understory palm, Chamaedorea radicalis, whose leaves are harvested for use in the international cut-greens industry. From 1999 to 2005, we exposed 100 adult palms to each of five leaf harvest treatments (N = 500): control (no harvest), 1× (harvest once/year), 2× (harvest twice/year), 4× (harvest four times/year), and a modified 4× treatment (4×m) where only one leaf was removed per harvest and no palms were completely defoliated. Leaf production, leaf length, palm survival, and reproductive activity were monitored throughout the study. These data were incorporated with demographic data on seeds, seedlings, and juveniles to parameterize stage-based transition matrices for each year × treatment combination to estimate λ, the finite rate of population growth. Leaf harvest increased mortality rates, and reduced palm growth and reproductive activity. Three of the harvest treatments reduced λ compared to the control treatment, and two of these (2×, 4×) significantly below the replacement rate of 1.0. Only in the 4×m treatment was λ not significantly different than the control. No differences in leaf yield were found among the harvest treatments; though yield generally averaged ≤1 leaf per palm per year, it did not decline over the 6 years. Incorporating the price of leaves with leaf yield indicated that income generated per hectare per year ranged from US$ 7-31. Since the 1× and 4×m treatments had yields comparable to more intense harvest treatments with fewer ecological impacts, these treatments could serve as a foundation for the development of sustainable palm harvest and management plans. Harvesting only once per year is the most efficient strategy, as comparable yield is obtained in the fewest days of work. Conservation strategies, such as not harvesting from reproductively active plants, should enhance C. radicalis recruitment, with minimal impact on harvester income. Our findings indicate that sustainable C. radicalis harvest can be achieved with few modifications of current harvest practices. In general our conclusions are similar to those based on a two-year intensive study. It is not clear whether these findings apply to other harvested Chamaedorea species, since species differ in life history, habitats, and leaf selection criteria. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, there are no known studies on the impacts of commercial salal harvesting on subsequent growth. A study was therefore initiated to quantify the growth of salal 1 year after commercial harvesting, and to compare this with growth of unharvested salal. The amount of biomass removed from shrubs through commercial harvesting (131 g m-2) was the same as the amount of annual growth in adjacent undisturbed plots (135 g m-2). One year later, the amount of regrowth in previously harvested plots (144 g m-2) was greater than the amount of new growth in adjacent undisturbed plots (111 g m-2). As there was little difference in the weight per current stem, the increased biomass after commercial harvesting was attributed to the observed increase in stem number (60 stems m-2) as compared to undisturbed salal (50 stems m -2).

Ecologically sustainable management of matsutake has been hindered by the lack of essential information such as reliable distribution maps. Although a variety of spatial distribution models have been applied to map many different plants, this has rarely been attempted for mushrooms. In this study, we employed a logistic regression and a GIS expert system to model the fine-scale spatial distribution of matsutake in Yunnan, southwest China. Both models predicted mushroom habitat to an accuracy acceptable for resource management. The overall mapping accuracy of the GIS expert system was slightly better than the logistic regression model (70.37% versus 65.43%). Furthermore, unlike the logistic regression model, developing the GIS expert system required no field-based samples. This has important practical implications because it is very difficult to survey and sample mushrooms and other non-wood forest products (NWFP), which are usually inconspicuous species and/or lower plants. Therefore, when adequate samples are not available, incorporating local expert knowledge can help make better-informed management decisions and provide an affordable habitat identification tool. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study investigated the intensity of NTFP collection, the financial benefits gained through the collection of a representative species, and the contextual factors influencing NTFP collection and sale in 12 villages of the Baitadi district of far western Nepal. Thirty-nine per cent of the economically active population collected a total of 24 NTFPs from 23 species, which contributed 0-90% of the total household income. A marketing chain and financial analysis of Valeriana jatamansi (sugandhwal) revealed that various trading and marketing channels existed from the village to district-level NTFP outlets. The price received by the collector depended on the length of the market chain and the political context of the market. Political instability resulting from the Maoist insurgency reduced profits from sugandhwal sale by 23-25%. The number of NTFP-selling outlets accessed by collectors was the most important variable determining the number of NTFPs collected and the overall contribution of NTFPs to the household. Physical accessibility of the village did not impact the contribution of NTFPs to the household livelihood. The strength of NTFP-related institutions (both government and non-governmental organizations) decreased the total NTFP contribution to livelihoods because at the time of the study the villages were in transition to domestication of NTFPs. In the future, the contribution of domesticated NTFPs to households in villages with strong NTFP-related institutions should be much greater than at present. Increasing access to NTFP-selling outlets may be achieved through information dissemination, empowerment of collectors and establishment of linkages between collectors and traders. In general, domestication is an important strategy to ensure a continuous supply of NTFPs. Middlemen traders are seen as important stabilizers of prices as long as fair trading practices are followed. Monitoring of these villages over time will also provide important new quantitative information on the process of transition in rural villages changing from a forest-collection NTFP procurement strategy to a domestication procurement strategy. © 2006 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Asset; Himalaya; Medicinal plant; Multiple-use; Non-wood forest product; Trade","Environmental impact; Geographical regions; Information dissemination; Rural areas; Assets; Medicinal plants; Multiple-use; Non-wood forest products; Forestry; domestication; financial system; hill; household income; marketing; nontimber forest product; political reform; rural economy; article; domestication; economic development; environmental economics; financial management; forest; government; household; income; information dissemination; marketing; monitoring; Nepal; organization; politics; Commerce; Forestry; Asia; Eurasia; Nepal; South Asia; Valeriana jatamansi","Webb, E.L.; Natural Resources Management, PO Box 4, Klong Luang, Pathum Thani, 12120, Thailand; email: ewebb@ait.ac.th",,,03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

A family of four could make a profit of 5,600-8,400 € in a season (average annual income per family in the area is 18,727 €). Pickers sell the harvested mushrooms either to a local middleman or directly to the buyer, who then takes the produce to the final point of sale, usually in Catalonia, where the demand for saffron milk caps is increasing yearly. This trade has occurred for 30 years, and began when saffron milk caps started to appear in the area after pine trees were introduced to replace the native oaks.

However, cultural factors affecting the choice of sanitation solutions have not yet been sufficiently investigated, particularly not in Muslim communities. To understand the perceptions of rural Muslim communities regarding alternative sanitation systems, members of households, key informants and women and men's focus groups in Machaki village in the district of Karak, North West Frontier Province (NWFP), were interviewed. A menu of both ecological and conventional sanitation options was put forward for consideration. All respondents were strongly opposed to the urine-separating latrines and in favor of flush toilets. They see any form of latrines as an age-old fashion, backwards and a matter of taboo, while flush toilets are considered prestigious and desirable. Muslim practices of anal cleansing together with the strict religious prohibition of contact with urine and faeces are factors influencing the reluctance towards latrines. The physical appearance of faeces and urine in latrines is repulsive to people. However, the material is less objectionable once it has disappeared in water and relocated to a treatment site. The rural community showed interest in the construction of improved sanitation consisting of flush toilets and an underground sewerage system and recycling of plant nutrients from urine and faeces through treatment in constructed wetlands. The study underlines the importance of incorporating cultural preferences in the planning of improved sanitation, particularly when designing low-cost ecological systems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a useful quantity to compare the relative importance of different materials and soil types. Majority of houses in Pakistan are mainly constructed from soil and sand. Therefore, studies concerning the determination of radon exhalation rate from these materials were carried out using CR-39 based NRPB radon dosimeters. In this context, samples were collected from different towns of the Bahawalpur Division, Punjab and major cities of NWFP. After treatment, samples were placed in plastic containers and dosimeters were installed in it at heights of 25 cm above the surface of the samples. These containers were hermetically sealed and stored for three weeks to attain equilibrium between 222Rn and 226Ra. After exposure to radon, CR-39 detectors were etched in 25% NaOH at 80 °C for 16 h. From the measured radon concentration values, 222Rn exhalation rates were determined. It ranged from 1.56 to 3.33 Bq m- 2 h- 1 for the soil collected from the Bahawalpur Division and 2.49-4.66 Bq m- 2 h- 1 for NWFP. The 222 Rn exhalation rates from the sand samples were found to range from 2.78 to 20.8 Bq m- 2 h- 1 for the Bahawalpur Division and from 0.99 to 4.2 Bq m- 2 h- 1 for NWFP. 226Ra contents were also determined in the above samples which ranged from 28 to 36.5 Bq kg- 1 in the soil samples collected from the Bahawalpur Division and from 40.9 to 51.9 Bq kg- 1 in the samples collected from NWFP. In sand samples, 226Ra contents ranged from 49.2 to 215 Bq kg- 1 and 22.6-27 Bq kg- 1 in the samples collected from the Bahawalpur Division and NWFP, respectively. 226Ra contents in these samples were also determined using HPGe detector.

The findings provide a mean or composite picture, averaged across the sample households within each community. Yet, within any given community, there is significant socio-economic differentiation. It is important to acknowledge such differentiation when considering policy and management interventions to support rural livelihoods and promote sustainable resource use. This paper reports on a study in South Africa, the objective of which was to explore wealth-related differences and similarities in the use and value of NTFPs. Data on NTFP consumption, purchase, and sale were collected from households in three rural villages. Households were divided into three wealth classes and patterns of NTFPs use between the classes examined. There was no difference in the proportions of households in each wealth class using NTFPs, nor the total number of NTFPs used per household. Yet, there was some supporting evidence that poorer households derive greater benefits from NTFPs than do wealthy or intermediate households. One clear difference was that, with increasing wealth, households purchased significantly more NTFPs, and a greater proportion of wealthy households did so. Conversely, a greater proportion of poor households were involved in the sale of one or more NTFPs, and they sold a greater number per household, compared to wealthy and intermediate households. Detailed examination of use and value of four NTFPs (fuelwood, wild fruits, edible herbs, and grass hand brushes) revealed that in all instances, the poorest households used more of the resource per capita than the other wealth classes. This was not the case for comparisons based on the total household as the unit of analysis. Gross annual direct-use value did not differ between the wealth classes for any of the four NTFPs examined, at the household level. But on a per capita basis, a significantly higher gross annual direct-use value was evident within poorer households for fuelwood and edible herbs. The significance of these differences is discussed. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

While the forest canopy is left intact in most understory plantations, much of the midstory and understory vegetation is removed in order to increase light availability for cultivated species. We assessed the extent to which the removal of vegetation in understory plantations of Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel (Arecaceae) alters understory light conditions. We also examined how any changes in light availability may be reflected by changes in the composition of canopy tree seedlings regenerating in understory plantations. We employed a blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites; each site was paired with an adjacent, unmanaged forest site. Hemispherical canopy photographs were taken and canopy tree seedlings were identified and measured within 12 3 × 2 m randomly placed plots in each site for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks × 2 sites × 12 plots). Plantation management did not affect canopy openness or direct light availability but understory plantations had a higher frequency of plots with greater total and diffuse light availability than unmanaged forest. Comparisons of canopy tree seedling composition between understory plantations and unmanaged forest sites were less conclusive but suggest that management practices have the potential to increase the proportion of shade-intolerant species of tree seedlings establishing in plantations. Given the importance of advanced regeneration in gap-phase forest dynamics, these changes may have implications for future patterns of succession in the areas of forest where NTFPs are cultivated. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Advanced regeneration; Chamaedorea hooperiana; Enrichment planting; Hemispherical photographs; Los Tuxtlas, Mexico; Non-timber forest products; Seedling composition","forest ecosystem; light availability; nontimber forest product; plantation; remote sensing; rural area; tropical forest; understory; Mexico [North America]; North America; Arecaceae; Chamaedorea","Trauernicht, C.; Department of Botany, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, United States; email: weevepool@gmail.com",,,00063606,,BTROA,,"English","Biotropica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646467807

The seeds of these crops were also inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and the aflatoxin content and its relation with the proximate composition of seeds was studied. The effect of storage for different durations of time (2-3 and 12-18 months) on the aflatoxin content of seeds was also assessed. Aflatoxin content of cereals (wheat, maize and rice) ranged from 14 to 45 μg/kg, and that of nuts (almond, walnut and peanut) varied from 5 to 17 μg/kg. The aflatoxin content was within the safe limit (50 μg/kg) recommended by FAO. The aflatoxin content of inoculated seeds was significantly (p < 0.05) increased over control (un-inoculated seeds). This was positively related (r = 0.65) to moisture content of the seeds. However, negative correlation (r = -0.50) existed between aflatoxin and ash contents of the seeds. Protein, fat and total carbohydrate (NFE) contents were not much affected by inoculation. Prolonged storage for 18 months (1.5 years) significantly (p < 0.05) increased aflatoxin contents of seeds compared to short storage periods (2-3 months). It was concluded that aflatoxin content of food should be monitored to ensure food safety.

The moss harvest monitoring program on the Siuslaw National Forest in the Pacific Northwest included a pilot stewardship program involving two 5-year leases of 890 ha parcels of mixed conifer-Alnus forest to a local commercial moss harvester under the condition that the harvester adhere to specific harvest guidelines and provide data on how much moss was removed. Across both lease areas, nearly 66,000 kg of tree-moss was harvested over a 48-month period, mostly during the dry summer season. The program provided for direct harvester participation, made the product available on a year-round basis, and improved patrol of illegal harvest in the lease area. In addition, three experiments were conducted to contrast moss abundance, species richness, and species composition using four levels of harvest intensity (Control in which harvest was prohibited, Low Intensity harvest approximating current standards and guidelines = ca. 34 kg/ha, High Intensity harvest approximating unregulated harvest levels = ca. 112 kg/ha, and ""No Rules"" harvest with no restrictions of any kind). Subsampling data indicated that cover on vine maple shrubs immediately following harvest was reduced by 5% and 16-20% for Low Intensity and High Intensity harvest treatments, respectively. These treatment differences remained for two years in riparian areas but were non-significant after one year in upland mixed forest. Species richness did not vary among harvest intensities and impacts to species composition, which were generally restricted to stems actually harvested, dissipated after one or two years. Because impacts restricted to harvested stems averaged out at the plot-level, plot-level surveys were less sensitive to harvest impacts than host-level subsampling. Due to the slow rate of recovery of this resource, future Stewardship Areas for moss harvest may be impractical, but this approach may be a viable option for non-timber forest products with shorter rotations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Following several years of intense political and legal debates, the final NWFP was approved in 1994. Even though the plan evolved with a broad ecosystem perspective, it remained anchored in the Spotted Owl reserve design proposed in 1990. Based on a criterion of stable or increasing populations, a decade later it remains unclear whether the enactment of the NWFP has improved the conservation status of Spotted Owls. The results of intensive monitoring of several Spotted Owl populations for over a decade suggest a continuing range-wide decline even though rates of timber harvest have declined dramatically on federal lands. The cause of the decline is difficult to determine because the research needed to establish cause and effect relations has not been done. One plausible hypothesis is that the owl's life history greatly constrains its rate of population growth even when habitat is no longer limiting. Since enactment of the NWFP, new threats have arisen, including the movement of Barred Owls (S. varia) into the range of the Spotted Owl, political pressure to increase levels of timber harvest, and recent changes to forest laws that eliminate the requirement to assess the viability of wildlife populations on U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service lands. At this time is appears that Spotted Owl conservation rests critically on continued implementation of the protections afforded by the NWFP and the U.S. Endangered Species Act. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Conservation planning; Endangered Species Act; Northern Spotted Owl Strix occidentalis caurina; Timber harvest","conservation planning; raptor; species conservation; timber harvesting; animal; ecosystem; environmental protection; forestry; history; legal aspect; methodology; organization and management; owl; review; tree; United States; weather; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; History, 20th Century; Northwestern United States; Strigiformes; Trees; Weather; Strigiformes; Strix occidentalis caurina; Strix varia","Noon, B.R.; Department of Fishery and Wildlife Biology, , Fort Collins, CO 80523, United States; email: brnoon@cnr.colostate.edu",,,08888892,,CBIOE,"16903090","English","Conserv.

In general, priming was found to increase yields of both grain and straw (an important product in NWFP agriculture). Grain yield increases due to priming were up to 53% in the participatory trials. Optimum duration of priming was between 12 and 16 h, and the response to priming was better in low potential environments than under better conditions. Priming was also more advantageous on saline-sodic than on saline soils, possibly as a result of the water content of the soil.

Approximately 400 species of amphibians, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, mollusks, vascular plants, arthropod functional groups, and one mammal were listed under this program because viability evaluations indicated the plan's network of reserve land allocations might not sustain the species over time. The program's standards and guidelines used an adaptive approach, protecting known sites and collecting new information to address concerns for species persistence and to develop management strategies. Since implementation in 1994, approximately 68,000 known sites have been recorded at an expense of several tens of millions of dollars. New knowledge from surveys reduced concern for nearly 100 species, and they were removed from the protection list. Although successful in protecting hundreds of rare species not typically considered in most conservation programs, some of the enacted conservation measures created conflicts in meeting other management objectives of the plan, particularly timber harvest. The program accrued important gains in knowledge, reduced uncertainty about conservation of a number of species, and developed new methods of species inventory that will be useful in future management planning and implementation at many scales. The program, however, was not completed because of changes in land-management philosophy. Ongoing litigation regarding its termination and potential changes to the plan cast further uncertainty on how the original goal of maintaining persistence of late-successional and old-growth species will be met and measured. The outcomes, controversies, and management frustrations of the program exemplify the inherent difficulties in balancing broad, regional conservation goals with social and economic goals of the NWFP. Defining acceptable trade-offs to reach that balance and developing practical conservation solutions remain challenges for the science and management communities. Lessons learned from the program provide a valuable biological and managerial reference to benefit future discussion on meeting those challenges. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Adaptive management; Coarse-filter conservation approach; Fine-filter conservation approach; Reserves; Species persistence","adaptive management; conservation planning; forest management; old-growth forest; Amphibia; animal; arthropod; ecosystem; environmental protection; forestry; fungus; history; lichens; mammal; management; methodology; mollusc; moss; organization and management; politics; practice guideline; review; time; tree; United States; Amphibia; Animals; Arthropods; Bryophyta; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; Fungi; Guidelines; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Lichens; Mammals; Mollusca; Northwestern United States; Policy Making; Politics; Time Factors; Trees; Amphibia; Arthropoda; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Fungi; Mammalia; Mollusca; Tracheophyta","Molina, R.; U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service, 620 SW Main Street, Portland, OR 97205, United States; email: rmolina@fs.fed.us",,,08888892,,CBIOE,"16903092","English","Conserv.

Many landscapes are dominated by agricultural fields and fallow lands, so we should understand the status of NTFP in these landscapes. We studied the availability of leaves of xa'an palm trees (Sabal yapa Wright ex Beccari) in the shifting cultivation systems among the Yucatec Maya in Mexico. The mature leaves of this species of palm have been widely used for roofing since prehispanic times until present days; in the year 2000, approximately 90,000 people used S. yapa in Quintana Roo, and 360,000 used Sabal spp. in the Yucatán peninsula. This palm is managed by Maya farmers who spare palm trees when clearing a forest patch to turn it into maize fields (milpa). We compared the population structure and leaf production rate in different stages of the shifting cultivation cycle (milpa, fallow lands and forest), and quantified the domestic leaf demand in the village of X-Maben, state of Quintana Roo. In addition, we projected future availability of xa'an leaves, and estimated the period after which this might not be sufficient enough to cover the local demand of some villages and municipalities of Quintana Roo. Our results suggest that one of the consequences of shifting cultivation is the decrease in the availability and quality of this NTFP. Decreasing availability is a result of variations in population structure and leaf production rates between agriculture and forest patches. These negative effects may increase as agriculture becomes more intensive. Currently, the complete mosaic landscape created by this practice still offers sufficient resources for the local inhabitants in many communities. Besides, this NTFP has a high commercial potential in the tourist area. Our study suggests that the harvest of S. yapa in natural systems is sustainable for nine more decades and will be compatible with shifting cultivation as long as land tenure remains communal, there are long fallow periods and other factors remain unchanged. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, in practice, NTFP commercialization has often failed to deliver the expected benefits. Progress in analyzing the causes of such failure has been hindered by the lack of a suitable framework for the analysis of NTFP case studies, and by the lack of predictive theory. We address these needs by developing a probabilistic model based on a livelihood framework, enabling the impact of NTFP commercialization on livelihoods to be predicted. The framework considers five types of capital asset needed to support livelihoods: natural, human, social, physical, and financial. Commercialization of NTFPs is represented in the model as the conversion of one form of capital asset into another, which is influenced by a variety of socio-economic, environmental, and political factors. Impacts on livelihoods are determined by the availability of the five types of assets following commercialization. The model, implemented as a Bayesian Belief Network, was tested using data from participatory research into 19 NTFP case studies undertaken in Mexico and Bolivia. The model provides a novel tool for diagnosing the causes of success and failure in NTFP commercialization, and can be used to explore the potential impacts of policy options and other interventions on livelihoods. The potential value of this approach for the development of NTFP theory is discussed. Copyright © 2006 by the author(s).

We based the analysis on a standardized expert-judgment assessment of the livelihood and environmental outcomes of 55 cases of NTFP trade from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The results show that NTFP trade benefits several components of peoples' livelihoods, but may increase inequality between households. Involvement of women in the production-to-consumption system (PCS) tends to have apositive impact on intrahousehold equity. In 80% of the cases, the commercial production of NTFPs does not enable people to make financial investments to increase quality and quantity of production, limiting the potential for development. In our set of cases, commercial extraction from the wild, without further management, tends to lead to resource depletion. NTFP production systems are generally considered to have lower environmental values than natural forest, but do contribute positively to the environmental values in the landscape. We found that higher livelihood outcomes are associated with lower environmental outcomes and conclude that NTFP trade is not likely to reconcile development and conservation of natural forest.

Do public health care centers in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP) comply with minimum UN recommendations for availability, use, and quality of basic and comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC) as measured by UN process indicators? METHODS: All public health facilities providing EmOC (n = 50) in 30% of districts in NWFP province (n = 8 districts) sampled randomly in September 2003 were included in a cross-sectional study. Data came from health facility records. RESULTS: Almost all indicators were below minimum recommended UN levels. The number of facilities providing basic EmOC services was much too low to be called providing comprehensive coverage. A low percentage of births took place in hospital and few women with complications reached EmOC facilities. Caesarean section was either underutilized or unavailable. The case fatality rate was low, perhaps due to poor record-keeping. CONCLUSION: The findings of this first needs assessment in NWFP province can serve as a benchmark for monitoring future progress. In resource-poor countries like Pakistan, it is important to upgrade existing facilities, giving special emphasis to facilities that provide basic EmOC services, since many problems can be resolved at the most basic level. Health policy makers and planners need to take immediate, appropriate rectifying measures to, inter alia, improve staffing in rural areas, enhance staff skills through training, upgrade management and supervision, ensure medical supply availability, mandate proper record-keeping, and observe progress by monitoring process indicators regularly.",,"article; emergency health service; female; geography; health care delivery; human; maternal mortality; obstetrics; organization and management; Pakistan; perinatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; utilization review; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Geography; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Obstetrics; Pakistan; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome","Ali, M.email: denube5@yahoo.com",,,10259589,,,"17591002","English","J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548610448

It is estimated that about 500 maternal deaths occur per 100,000 live births each year in Pakistan. It is a well known fact that all health statistics coming out of the developing countries are calculated ""guesstimates"" some are perhaps more close to the real figures than the others. There is a dire need to help generate information that can be used by health professionals, health care planners and managers to save women's lives by improving the quality of care provided to turn away maternal mortality. The maternal mortality ratio for Pakistan as well as for NWFP is projected as 533/100,000 live births for the year 1990-91 produced by National Institute of Population Studies, Pakistan. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional quantitative study for the period (2001-2002) conducted in five districts of (NWFP) North Western Frontier Province, Pakistan. RESULTS: National HMIS data opened the maternal mortality ratio for; Haripur as 0.168 and 0.173, Mansehra 00 and 00, Battagram 00 and 00, Swat 0.051. and 0.524 and Swabi 00 and 0.968 per/1000 live births, respectively. The small part exercise outcome (the study) endorsed more shadowy side of the actual maternal mortality ratio for the same period in the same districts. CONCLUSION: In our country there is a urgent need to institute an efficient mode of operation to get accurate maternal mortality database. Verbal Autopsy method is cost effective and feasible approach for implementation in a country like Pakistan.",,"adult; article; cause of death; cross-sectional study; factual database; female; human; maternal mortality; Pakistan; retrospective study; Adult; Cause of Death; Cross-Sectional Studies; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Maternal Mortality; Pakistan; Retrospective Studies","Farooq, N.email: drnasirf@yahoo.com",,,10259589,,,"16977818","English","J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750601120

Althouoh revisiting of official poverty line for 2001-02 by the Planning Commission is rationally and empirically valid the consumer price index (CPI)-adjusled official poverty line for 2004-05 lacks empirical support, invoking questions of the relevance of poverty estimates based on the CPI approach. The use of CPI underestimates the poverty level in 2004-05, as inflation as measured by CPI is lower than the household survey-based index and sensitive price index. Based on poverty lines from the household survey data using the official methodology, the results indicate that incidence of poverty first increased in Pakistan from 31.1 percent in 1998-99 to 34.4 percent in 2001-02, and then declined to 29.3 percent in 2004-05. The high inflation seems to have eroded the positive effects of rapid economic growth, resulting in higher poverty line and slower poverty reduction. It is, thus, essential to reduce inflation if the government aims to protect the poor. Considering the 1998-99 to 2004-05 period as whole, the results indicate that although the incidence of poverty declined by 1.8 percentage points, the number of poor increased by 2.6 million in Pakistan during the same period. At the province level, rural poverty declined in Sindh, followed by Punjab and the NWFP, whereas it increased in Balochistan between 1998-99 and 2004-05. Similarly, urban poverty declined only in Punjab and Sindh, whereas it remained stagnant in the NWFP and Balochistan during this period. While good governance has been an important pillar of Pakistan's poverty reduction suatcgy, governance indicators constructed by independent institutions showed a worsening of trends. Trends in corruption also indicate that country's ranking as having highly corrupt public officials and politicians worsened during this period. The evidence of rising extent of corruption is consistent with the rising trends in inequality, since corruption increases inequality through perpetuating unequal distribution of assets. The worsening of governance indicators accompanied by a decline in poverty suggests that reduction in poverty was largely attributable to high economic growth. Had the governance indicators improved, the reduction in poverty would have been much higher. Thus, there is a need to pursue governance reforms more vigorously to improve the state of governance that would enhance the current rate of poverty reduction.",,,"Anwar, T.; UNDP Project, , Islamabad, Pakistan; email: talatanwar@netscape.net",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

The major industries include textile, pharmaceutical, chemicals (organic and inorganic), food industries, ceramics, steel, oil mills and leather tanning which spread all over four provinces, with the larger number located in Sindh and Punjab, with smaller number in North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan. Hattar Industrial Estate extending over 700 acres located in Haripur district of NWFP is a new industrial estate, which has been developed with proper planning for management of industrial effluents. The major industries located in Hattar are ghee industry, chemical (sulfuric acid, synthetic fiber) industry, textile industry and pharmaceuticals industry. These industries, although developed with proper planning are discharging their effluents in the nearby natural drains and ultimately collected in a big drain near Wah. The farmers in the vicinity are using these effluents for growing vegetables and cereal crops due to shortage of water. In view of this discussion, there is a dire need to determine if these effluents are hazardous for soil and plant growth. So, effluents from different industries, sewage and normal tap water samples were collected and analysed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total soluble salts (TSS), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen, cations and anions and heavy metals. The effluents of ghee and textile industries are highly alkaline. EC and TSS loads of ghee and textile industries are also above the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS), Pakistan. All the effluents had residual sodium carbonates (RSCs), carbonates and bicarbonates in amounts that cannot be used for irrigation. Total toxic metals load in all the effluents is also above the limit i.e. 2.0 mg/L. Copper in effluents of textile and sewage, manganese in ghee industry effluents and iron contents in all the effluents were higher than NEQS. BOD and COD values of all the industries are also above the NEQS. On the whole, these effluents cannot be used for irrigation without proper treatment otherwise that may cause toxicity to soil, plants and animals as well add to the problems of salinity and sododicity.

Many indigenous groups sought control over their traditional lands as essential to rebuilding their societies, and indigenous entrepreneurship was often used as a tool towards self-governance. The cases were characterised by extensive networks, with a large number of partners at the same level of social and political organisation (horizontal linkages). Vertical linkages typically involved three or four levels of political organisation. These connections went far beyond business networking and included, for example, environmental knowledge building.

For the last 1,000 years, the regions that constitute Pakistan today have been predominantly Muslim. The rule of the Muslim Mughal Empire in India formally came to an end in 1857, when the British (who had originally entered India as traders in the early seventeenth century) placed India directly under the crown and made Queen Victoria the Empress of India. For the following hundred years India was a British colony, and in 1947 when the British left India, Pakistan became an independent nation and a national homeland for Muslims. After Partition, East Pakistan, which had many linguistic and cultural differences from West Pakistan, seceded to become Bangladesh in 1971. Pakistan's present-day population is approximately 140 million, making it the seventh most populous country in the world. Islamabad is its capital, with a population of 805,000. ECOLOGICAL FEATURES Pakistan is bordered by India in the east, China in the north, and Iran and Afghanistan in the west. The landscape of the country is diverse; it has a coastline on the Arabian sea, long stretches of desert, fertile plains, and some of the highest mountain peaks in the world. Pakistan is divided into four provinces: Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan, and The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). © Cambridge University Press 2006.",,,,,"Cambridge University Press",,9780511489822; 0521822971; 9780521822978,,,"English","Families Across Cultures: A 30-Nation Psychological Study",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870835246

The species produces gum which is collected from natural exudation by the rural people. However, little information is available about the tapping possibility of A. seyal var. seyal. Therefore, a two-factor experiment was carried out at Umfakarin forest reserve in 2001/02. The first factor was time of tapping, which was tested in three levels (1st Nov., 15th Nov. and 1st Dec.). The second factor was tapping intensity, which was tested in four levels (2, 4, 6 and 8 branches). The results of the present study revealed the possibility of talh gum production by tapping A. seyal var. seyal. The tapping date had a significant effect on the amount of gum production. Trees in this experiment produced the highest gum yield when they were tapped on the 1st of November. However, the tapping intensity did not show a clear effect on the gum yield.

The present study provides information regarding the homicidal deaths due to firearm injuries in the district of Peshawar, NWFP, Pakistan. METHODOLOGY: This descriptive study was conducted over the period of the year 2004. Data were collected from the autopsy records of the Department of Forensic Medicine, Khyber Medical College Peshawar and included all reported unnatural deaths from urban and rural areas of district Peshawar on whom autopsies were conducted in the department. RESULTS: Homicidal deaths constituted 77.7% (492/633) of all autopsies for the year 2004. Of 492 homicidal deaths, a vast majority of 452 (91.87%) were caused by firearm injuries. Among these, the male to female ratio was 5.5:1. The most common firearm weapon (418/452, 92.5%) were high velocity rifled weapons (Kalashnikov, rifles, pistols), followed by low velocity rifled weapons (18/452, 3.98%) and shotguns (16/452, 3.54%). A total of 956 injuries were found in various body areas, giving an average of over two injuries per person. The head, face and neck sustained the highest injuries (257, 26.9%), followed by the chest (248, 25.9%) and abdomen (149, 15.6%); the extremities, buttocks and genitalia together sustained 302 (31.6%) injuries. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of reported homicides in Peshawar are caused by firearm injuries, which bring up issues related to possession of firearms and changes in cultural attitudes towards use of firearms, if a decrease in firearm-related homicides is desired.",,"adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; female; forensic pathology; gunshot injury; homicide; human; male; middle aged; mortality; Pakistan; pathology; sex ratio; statistics; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Female; Forensic Pathology; Homicide; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Sex Distribution; Wounds, Gunshot","Hussain, Z.",,,10259589,,,"16773969","English","J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745496836

The experiment was laid out in RCB design, replicated four times with ten treatments, comprising hand weeding, weedy check, pre-transplanting herbicides; S-metalocholar @ 1.92, pendimethalin (EC) @ 1.00, pendimethalin (CS) @ 1.00, and butralin @ 1.44 kg a.i ha-1 and the post-transplanting herbicides include; clodinafop @ 0.04, fenoxaprop-p-ethyl @ 1.00, acetochlor @ 0.125 and glyphosate @ 0.95 kg a.i ha-1. None of the herbicides except S-metalocholar had a phytotoxic effect on tobacco. All the parameters except the number of leaves plant-1 were significantly affected by different treatments. The highest (228.3) weeds density m -2 was observed in weedy check while minimum (69) was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment. The maximum grade index of 74.60% was recorded in acetochlor and minimum grade index of 53.88% was recorded in S-metalocholar treatments. Nicotine (%) was higher in pendimethalin (EC) treated plots with 2.362%; however it was comparable to all other treatments. The maximum percent reducing sugar of 18.22% was recorded in pendimethalin (CS) treatment, while minimum of 12.42% reducing sugar was recorded in weedy check. Similarly maximum yield of 2465 kg ha-1 was recorded in pendimethalin (EC) treatment and minimum yield of 1703 kg ha-1 was recorded in weedy check (control) treatment. Thus it can be concluded from the experiment that herbicides proved effective against weeds and their growth and promoted tobacco quality and yield. Hence the use of herbicides not only increases the net income of the farmers but also will make the weed seed bank poorer.","Herbicides; Tobacco; Weeds; Yield",,"Yousafzai, H.K.; Department of Weed Science, P.O.

To understand whether political decentralisation can improve public service provision for the poor and for women, it is important to know to what extent these groups use their vote to exercise voice and demand accountability. The paper develops a conceptual framework that captures the links between voting and public service provision, and analyses data from a voter and candidate survey of the 2005 Local Government Elections in Pakistan. The survey was conducted by the Pattan Development Foundation. The results show that except in the North West Frontier Province (NWFP), income status and residence in rural areas did not discourage people from voting. Voter turnout among illiterate citizens and citizens from rural areas was higher than that among literate and urban citizens. The data also suggest that women, very poor citizens, and rural citizens are more inclined to use their vote to improve their living conditions than the other groups. Expectedly, voter turnout among men was hifgher than the among women. However, there were considerable administrative obstacles for citizens to vote, such as a lack of identity cards and incomplete election lists. Poor people and women were more affected by these problems than others. Only half of the citizens believed that the electoral outcomes of the 2005 elections accurately reflected people's voting decisions. More than 40 percent of the very poor consider the opinion of the landlord and his political faction in their voting decision, an indication of the elite capture problem. The paperconcludes that improvements in the electoral process and capacity strengthening of elected representatives may help to increase the impact of decentralisation on public service provision for the poor and for women in Pakistan.","Administrative processes in public organisation; Bureaucracy; Corruption; Education and welfare; Health; Public provided goods; Scope and performance of government; State and local government; Structure",,"Birner, R.; International Food Policy, , Washington, DC, United States; email: r.birner@ciear.org",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

This paper is motivated to fill the gap in policy analysis by estimating the human capital index (HCI) at the provincial level from 1982-83 to 2003-04. The accumulated human capital is estimated using the labour-income-based methodology. Using data from the respective Labour Force Surveys, the index is computed for three sectors of the economy: Agriculture, Manufacturing, and Services. The estimation is divided into three steps: (i) computation of the relative wage rates, a proxy for productivity; (ii) estimation of the proportion of employed labour force in each sector, by province, according to the level of education, and age; (iii) multiplication of productivity with total employed labour force, by education level, and age. The analysis is disaggregated by sector, and by province. The aggregate human capital index almost doubled in the 22 years analysed (1982-2004), growing at an average of 3.3 percent per annum. Breaking down the analysis according to the three time-periods, (i) 1982-1990, (ii) 1991-1999, and (iii) 2000-2004, confirms a slow-down in human capital formation in the 1990s. Province-wise analysis further illustrates that the slow-down in the 1990s was mostly driven by a decline in human capital accumulation in the Sindh province in the time-period 1990-1999. Sindh HCI grew at 4.8 percent per annum in the 1980s but lost this momentum in the 1990s, with growth per annum declining to 1.5 ercent. However, from 2000 onwards, Sindh regained its growth momentum, and in turn, the overall national-level HCI recovered its original growth trajectory. Province-level analysis further illustrates that human capital accumulation was most consistent in Punjab (hovering around 3.2 percent) during the 22-year period considered. The NWFP and Balochistan posted an annual growth of 2.6 percent and 3.4 percent per annum in this time-period. However their combined share in the national-level HCI is only 13 percent, and therefore their contribution towards the aggregate human capital accumulation remains limited. The sector-wise analysis further demonstrates that dunng the period 1982-83 to 2003-04, HCI growth was largely driven by human capital development in the manufacturing and services sectors.","Human capital index; Labour productivity; Mincer-wage equation; Province-wise HCI",,"Sabir, M.; GRBI, Karachi, Pakistan; email: muhammadsabirkhan@yahoo.com",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

Alternately they have to borrow from traders at high interest rates because they do not have access to formal financial institutions. Provisions for creating access to microfinance will enable FDs to undertake NWFPs value additions and save them from exploitation by moneylenders and traders.

It focuses on the contributions of forest products and markets, questioning the typical timber vs non-timber dichotomy. The role and the potential of a forest product is determined more by the socio-economic and environmental context of the production, processing and marketing system than by the physical characteristics of the product itself. This is important as new opportunities arise through increased control of resources by local people and new markets for forest products. Helping achieve poverty alleviation through forestry requires protecting poverty mitigation functions, enhancing income and employment options, and taking advantage of opportunities to build and strengthen local institutions through policies and project-level interventions.","Forest products; Livelihoods; Markets; NTFP; Poverty","forest resource; forestry; market system; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; social development; socioeconomic impact; timber","Belcher, B.M.; Forests and Livelihoods Program, P.O.

We examined the effects of fire on the demography of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP in the forests of Biligiri Rangan Hills, India. We then assessed demographic responses to the combined effects of fire and current fruit harvesting patterns. Fruits of Phyllanthus are commercially harvested by an indigenous forest dwelling people. Using matrix population models, we compared demographic indices across a chronosequence of time since last fire. Population growth rates (λ) ranged from 0.7692 to 1.1443 across the five times since last fire. λ was the lowest at times since last fire of 2 and 3 yr. Frequent fires increased time to maturity by altering growth and survival rates, thereby causing a demographic shift from growth to regressions or negative growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that stasis of adults makes the biggest contribution to λ. Simulations of periodic and stochastic fire regimes suggest that higher λ and population persistence can be achieved at fire-return intervals of ≥7 and ≥9 yr, respectively. These fire-return intervals became longer when the simulations included harvesting and fire. Extinction probabilities under the current fire regimes (every 2-3 yr) suggest that populations will decline to lower densities. Our findings provide critical information for developing guidelines for sustainable use and management of NTFPs in Biligiri Rangan Hills, and demonstrate the need to incorporate various human-generated physical regimes in assessing sustainability of NTFPs. © Springer 2005.","Demography; Fire; Harvesting; India; Nontimber forest products; Phyllanthus emblica; Sustainability","fire; forest management; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; Asia; Eurasia; India; South Asia; Phyllanthus emblica","Sinha, A.; Department of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences, P.O.

In the Yucatan Peninsula, this palm has been introduced to pasturelands, maize fields (milpas), and homegardens. These and other traditional management systems are usually believed to be sustainable, but there is as yet little evidence to support this hypothesis. Demographic models have been used for this purpose, mainly focusing on population growth rate (λ). So far, retrospective analysis has not been applied, even though it examines how changes in the the life cycle of a species, caused by different management regimes, affect its λ. In this study, we assess whether ecologically sustainable use of xa'an occurs in homegardens, pasturelands, and milpas, and if so, how it is achieved. We constructed matrix population models for four populations of xa'an that were followed for 3 years, and then conducted a retrospective analysis on them. Management in homegardens seems to be oriented to increasing the availability of xa'an leaves, favoring the survival of seedlings, and increasing the density of harvestable-sized palms. However, in the milpa and the pastureland, the population size structure resembles that of unmanaged populations. Our λ values suggest that the traditional use of xa'an in all the studied management regimes is sustainable. Nevertheless, the processes that lead to sustainable use are different in each system, as shown by our retrospective analysis. Although fecundity contributes positively to λ only in homegardens, permanence and growth maintain palm populations at an equilibrium in the pastureland and in the milpa, respectively. Between-year climatic differences had a smaller impact on λ than management practices, which may vary from one year to another, leading to different balances in the sustainable use of the populations involved. Even though no significant differences were found in λ values, Maya achieve sustainable use of xa'an palm under diverse scenarios by managing the great plasticity of the species, as was revealed by the retrospective analysis. Hence, this approach proved to be effective, not only for assessing sustainable use, but also for understanding the factors that favor or limit it. Copyright © 2005 by the author(s).

While many studies of NTFP management have focused on the effects of harvesting on wild populations, the impacts of understory NTFP plantations, or enrichment plantings, on forest community composition and structure have not been investigated. We assessed the effects of understory plantations of the palm Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel, on community composition and structure of an old growth tropical rain forest in the Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Mexico. A blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites each paired with an adjacent site of unmanaged forest was used to compare the plant species richness and diversity, stem density, basal area and size class structure in plantations versus unmanaged forest. In each site, 12 10 m diameter plots were established for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks x 2 sites x 12 plots). Although the stem density, diversity, richness and basal area of large overstory trees (≥20 cm dbh) were unaffected by the establishment and management of understory palm plantations, the stem density, species richness and basal area of woody species in smaller size classes (<10 cm dbh) were significantly lower in plantation sites than in similar unmanaged forest sites. The density of naturally occurring, economically valuable palm species was unaffected by the C. hooperiana plantations, indicating that these understory species are spared when plantations are established and maintained. However, plantation sites showed significant reductions in the density of the midstory palm Astrocaryum mexicanum, the most abundant plant in unmanaged forest sites. The removal of vegetation in NTFP plantations may result in the fragmentation and/or elimination of local populations of understory and midstory plant species. In addition, changes to the composition of advanced regeneration due to the removal of canopy tree seedlings and saplings may have implications for future patterns of forest regeneration and composition. Nonetheless, NTFP cultivation offers a promising alternative to more destructive forms of land uses in the tropics and warrants further attention as a forest management strategy. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

This study presents findings on the value of NTFP extraction by indigenous people, the Jah Hut, in Krau Wildlife Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, including an analysis of factors influencing extraction levels. Data was collected in four villages using rapid rural appraisal and structured interviews of 127 households. The average value of extracted NTFPs was estimated using the indirect opportunity cost method. The average value of extraction is estimated at PPP US$ 2,455 hh-1 yr-1 and PPP US$ 40.7 ha-1 yr-1. There is evidence that poorer villages and households depend most on NTFP extraction. However, traditional Jah Hut activities, including NTFP extraction, are replaced by wage labour when available. It is argued that NTFP dependence is presently high, and thus NTFPs may contribute to improve rural livelihoods, but likely to be reduced as the Jah Hut are increasingly integrated into the Malaysian society. The advantages and disadvantages of using the indirect opportunity cost method to estimate the value of NTFPs are discussed. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

It is the final stage of the Tarbela Dam project and follows two centuries of irrigation development in the Indus Valley. The Pehur high-level canal (PHLC) is now operational after a five-year construction period which began in 1997. The purpose of the project is to bring 30 m3/s of water from the Indus River at Tarbela Dam to the lower reaches of the existing Upper Swat canal (USC) system. This not only alleviates water shortage in the existing 100 000 ha Upper Swat scheme but will allow additional areas totalling about 25 000 ha to be brought under irrigation upstream of the confluence with PHLC. The combined system Tarbela-PHLC and Swat river-USC is a complex one that is aimed at optimising water use from the two different sources, which are in restricted supply at different times of the year. Accordingly the design philosophy of PHLC is different to all other major canals in Pakistan. The project included several novel principles of design, construction and operation, such as automatic downstream control, large parabolic canals and low-pressure pipelines for irrigation distribution. The main project comprises two tunnels totalling 6 km, two large inverted siphons, each over 3 m dia. and about 2 km long, 26 km of concrete-lined parabolic canal (the largest of its kind in the world) and reconstruction of the existing 45 km long Maira branch canal. Cross-regulation of main and branch canals is provided by 13 pairs of self-regulating float-operated gates. The rugged terrain necessitated about 40 cross-drainage structures in the form of culverts and super-passages. Also included was rehabilitation of the existing minor canal system covering 40 000 ha and the development of about 5000 ha of new irrigation based on a buried pipeline distribution network. Commissioning was delayed by difficult tunnelling conditions, and several design modifications were required in commissioning the canal control gates. The more unconventional facets of the project's design were initially met with scepticism by the engineering establishment, but have been mostly vindicated by the project's successful completion.","Drainage & irrigation; Tunnels & tunnelling; Waterways & canals","Construction; Construction industry; Dams; Land use; Project management; Structural design; Tunneling (excavation); Water distribution systems; Water pipelines; Water supply systems; Automatic downstream control; Commissioning; Irrigation development; Parabolic canals; Pipeline distribution network; Irrigation canals; canal; construction project; culvert; drainage; irrigation system; tunneling; canal; construction; culvert; drainage; irrigation system; tunneling; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Indus Basin; Pakistan; South Asia; World","Laycock, A.; PHLC, , Oban, United Kingdom",,,17417589,,,,"English","Proc.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Place and duration of study: District Peshawar, NWFP, from July to September 2002. Patients and methods: A total of 646 females of reproductive age (15-49) years were selected from both urban and rural areas of Peshawar through stratified cluster sampling. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was administered to females. Two logistic regression models were built, one for all females and one for married females only. Results: Overall 65.0% females were vaccinated (95% confidence interval (CI) (61.3%, 68.6%). For all females, the variables that were significantly associated with vaccination status were marital status (OR= 8.5, 95% CI (4.7, 15.6)), source of information regarding tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination, knowledge regarding TT vaccination, visits of lady health worker (LHW) to a household (OR = 2.3, 95% CI (1.4, 3.9) and restriction on TT vaccination (OR = 28.7, 95% CI (3.5, 237.9)).

This palm has been used for more than 30 years; but there is no information about its life history or conservation status. Our objective was to characterize the life history of this palm and population dynamics of a natural population as a first step to assess the effect of leaf harvesting. More than 1600 palms were monitored from June 1999 to March 2000; we measured growth, mortality, and reproductive success. Population dynamics were evaluated using a Lefkovitch matrix model, and elasticity analysis. Results indicate that G. orbignyana grows at a rate of 1.98 ± 0.047 leaves/year, the palm has a long lifespan, and growth and reproduction are related to light conditions in the forest. The density of this palm is high (108-311 palms/100 m2), which is explained in part by its capacity to continue growing after damage, and to respond to the frequent gap formation in the forest. The population is growing (λ = 1.074, CI = [1.046-1.099]). Survival transitions account for 77% of population growth, a value that is higher compared to other understory plants. Because of the high density, the recovery capacity of these palms, and the correlations found between individual and population performances with forest dynamics, we hypothesize that G. orbignyana behaves as an opportunistic species taking advantage of forest gaps. This palm is a promising non-timber forest product (NTFP) with a high profile for further exploitation, although we recommend that harvesting regimens should consider time of recovery and forest dynamics. Without these considerations mortality could increase in all classes, which will compromise population persistence. Further studies should accurately estimate the recovery time after defoliation as well as to characterize forest dynamics identifying its most important features for population growth. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Based on characteristic symptoms expression and serological indexing, the major virus, viroid and prokaryotic diseases commonly observed in citrus orchards and nurseries were citrus tristeza, citrus variegation, citrus exocortis, citrus cachexia (-xyloprosis), citrus greening and stubborn. Average incidence of citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV) was 27%, citrus variegation ilarvirus (CVV) 31%, citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) 16%, citrus cachexia viroid (CCVd) 4%, citrus greening (Liberobacter sp) 4% and stubborn (Spiroplasma citri) 2%, respectively. High incidence of these devastating pathogens has caused the severe citrus decline syndrome and drastic yield and quality losses in citrus fruits in the region. The field isolates of CTV and CVV were reproduced on diagnostic hosts through graft and mechnical transmission. CTV produced vein clearing and chlorosis on young leaves of Citrus aurantium, C. lemon cv. Eureka, C. sinensis. Field isolates of CVV was readily sap transmitted on young seedlings of C. sinensis, C. aurantium and C. lemon cv.

Design: Observational study. Place and duration of study: Medical Out-patient Department (OPD), Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar and a private clinic of physician from January 2003 to December 2003. Patients and methods: Two hundred and ten patients with type-2 diabetes were included in the study. The glycemic control of these patients was determined by estimation of blood glucose (fasting and random) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c). The patients were grouped in three categories, the 1st one having good glycaemic control, the 2nd having fair (acceptable) glycaemic control and the 3rd group having poor diabetic control with their HbA1c values being 6%-7%, 7.1%-8.2% and &gt;8.2% respectively. Statistical analysis of the results was made by application of Pearson's chi-square test and student's t-test. Results: Around half, 51.43%, of the patients had poor control of diabetes, with mean HbA1c of 10.183 ± 1.73 SD (standard deviation) and were placed in category 3. Good control of diabetes accounted for 31.43% of our patients having mean HbA1c of 6.64 ± 0.27 SD and were placed in category-1.

This often occurs in the absence of any clear understanding of or guidelines regarding sustainable yields and ecological impacts, which may undermine the success of NTFP enterprises, especially from arid regions. This paper reports on the use of size class profiles and three quantitative indices to examine population profiles of five potentially useful tree species used as NTFPs in the semiarid lowveld of South Africa. We also contrast the population densities of the five tree species in 2003 with data from 1992. Low stem densities and population profiles indicated that three of the five species would preclude the establishment of NTFP enterprises based on their products. The other two species seem to have sufficient densities for some harvesting to take place, within an adaptive management framework. However, the longitudinal data indicated that the density of both these species had significantly declined over an eleven-year period, highlighting the need for appropriate management institutions. Additionally, the proportion of mature stems cut, and the degree of cutting per stem, had increased for all five species over the eleven years. The three quantitative indices of population stability were not correlated with one another, and hence provided a useful suite of measures sensitive to different aspects of size class profiles and their interpretation.

NTFP-yielding plants in the Western Ghats constituted about 40% of the flora. However, only less than 50% of the 229 NTFP species were commercially exploited. The rest were used by local people. Species richness was variable between sites but reflected disturbance regimes and/or the magnitude of NTFP extraction. During NTFP collection, often branches are lopped for harvesting fruits, fires are lit at the base of trees to stimulate resin flow and the bark is collected in a destructive manner. High extraction rates of some NTFPs resulted in poor density, sparse distribution of species and depletion of biodiversity. Yet herbaceous NTFP species, capable of regenerating through vegetative means, registered adequate regeneration, even when 95% of the plants were harvested. An understanding of the vital attributes of the NTFP species is, therefore, critical for sustainable NTFP management.","Biodiversity; Indigenous knowledge; Regeneration; Species loss","Biodiversity; Fires; Fruits; Resins; Timber; Harvesting fruits; Non-timber forest products (NTFP); NTFP management; Resin flow; Forestry; Biodiversity; Fires; Forestry; Forests; Fruits; Synthetic Polymers","Muraleedharan, P.K.; Kerala Forest Research Institute, Peechi, Kerala - 680 653, India; email: pkmurali@kfri.org",,,01281283,,JTFSE,,"English","J Trop Forest Sci",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27544446096

This study complements an earlier study by Alderman, Orazem, and Paterno (2001) exploring the same set of issue in urban Pakistan and, for ease of comparison, uses similar modeling and estimation techniques. We use data collected especially for this purpose in rural Punjab and Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) in 1997. In a context in which many children, particularly girls, never enter scholl, it is critical to understand more fully the determinants of enrollment. A unique contribution of the article is the construction of gender-specific dimensions of school accessibility and school quality according to school type. Within the same village, girls and boys often face starkly different options for schooling in terms of distance, type, and quality. Public primary schools are segregated by sex; private schools are more typically mixed but are also occasionally single sex. The article begins with a review of the literature on the determinants of school entry and choice in developing countries, with emphasis on the newer literature on school quality and public or private school choice. This is followed by an overview of educational policy and primary schooling in Pakistan. Next, we introduce our data, using them to provide some background on relevant dimensions of the schooling context in our sample villages. Finally, we present our findings from the multivariate analysis and conclude with some thoughts on educational policy in Pakistan. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

However, due to lack of relevant information on the level of output of non-timber products, its economic significance was seldom accounted for in the valuation of forests. Dry deciduous forests in India is one such typical case where forest valuation is yet to integrate the NTFP stock, widely used for subsistence and cash income. A detailed accounting of commercially valuable forest products harvested from dry deciduous forests of Eastern India was made to highlight the economic worth of forests and contribution of NTFPs. The net present value of revenues from NTFP was estimated to be US$ 1016 ha -1 in the coastal area and US$ 1348/ha in the inland area, which proved to be significantly higher than the returns from alternative land uses. Dry deciduous forests were estimated to have more value than had been assumed previously and compared favourably against potential timber revenue (US$ 268 ha-1). The result indicates the necessity of developing a new valuation protocol for use by forest managers while deciding conversion of forest lands for non-forestry purposes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Any subject having visual acuity <3/60 with or without obvious lens opacity or with aphakia (removal of lens) or pseudophakia (removal of cataract lens and implantation of artificial lens) was examined in detail. The surgical services were assessed by measuring the prevalence of pseudophakia, surgical outcome of visual acuity and also the effect of place of surgery on outcome. Results: Prevalence of total bilateral blindness was 2.6%, and unilateral blindness 2.46%. Total prevalence of aphakia was 2.4%, which was almost equal in both sexes, male 2.3% and female 2.4%. Prevalence of unilateral aphakia was 0.3% in females being slightly higher than males, 0.16%. The prevalence of bilateral aphakia was 2.2% and 2% in males and females respectively. Prevalence of total pseudophakic eyes was 2.74%. Surgical outcome showed good, borderline and poor visual acuity of 40.5%, 22% and 14.3% respectively. Surgical outcome was also seemed to be better in private hospitals as compared to field camps. Conclusion: It is concluded that to reduce the prevalence of blindness there was a need to improve the quality of services in mobile camps and fixed facilities. At the same time the visual outcome of surgery could be improved by expanding the number of Intraocular lens procedures and routine monitoring of cataract outcome.","Aphakia; Cataract; Prevalence; Pseudophakia; Rapid assessment of cataract surgical services","adult; aged; aphakia; article; blindness; cataract; cataract extraction; cluster analysis; community care; controlled study; female; groups by age; health care facility; health care quality; health survey; human; lens implant; major clinical study; male; outcomes research; Pakistan; patient monitoring; patient selection; pilot study; prevalence; private hospital; pseudophakia; randomization; sampling; sex difference; surgical technique; treatment outcome; visual acuity; visual system examination; Aged; Cataract; Cataract Extraction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Developing Countries; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pakistan; Pilot Projects; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Rural Health Services; Severity of Illness Index; Socioeconomic Factors; Vision Screening; Visual Acuity","Shaikh, S.P.Qamar Arcade, A-10 Block No. 3, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Karachi, Pakistan; email: sajidashaikh74@hotmail.com",,,1022386X,,JSPJE,"15808091","English","J.

Most research on NTFP management focuses on the dynamics of individuals within harvested populations, but the ways in which management may affect the dynamics of populations across a landscape and over time remain largely unexplored. Here, I use a metapopulation framework to assess the effects of management on populations of the fiber-harvested bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae, in the Sierra Santa Marta, Mexico. Specifically, I quantify rates of colonization, extinction and growth as well as size structure of A. magdalenae populations from 1997 to 2003; and compare these variables between wild versus outplanted populations and between old-growth versus secondary forest populations. Over the 5-year study period, 42% of the 31 wild A. magdalenae populations went extinct due to anthropogenic fires and to ramet harvest for the creation of enrichment plantings. Significantly more secondary forest populations went extinct than old-growth forest populations. Sixty-two outplanted populations were created and in contrast to wild populations and despite harvest, these outplantings increased in size and none went extinct. The structure of wild populations shifted towards fewer populations with less rosettes but overall numbers and sizes of populations increased. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of A. magdalenae populations over both time and space and the ways in which the fates of populations depend on decisions made by harvesters at both the population and the landscape level. In this case, sustainable harvest of A. magdalenae does not necessarily ensure population persistence. Outplanting of A. magdelanae appears to be functioning as a very successful forest conservation strategy. Nonetheless, the conservation of at least some wild populations may be required to ensure long-term survival of this species in this region. Metapopulation approaches may provide an important compliment to demographic studies of A. magdalenae and other NTFP. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A population-based cross-sectional study was carried out involving 1,106 men and women 40 years of age and older in a rural area in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP). All subjects with a presenting visual acuity <6/18 in either eye were referred to a centralized clinic for a standardized eye examination that included refraction and dilated fundal examination. The main outcome was blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in the better eye) and low vision (presenting VA <6/18-3/60 in the better eye). Results: Of 1,106 people examined, 21 (1.9%; 95% CI: 1.1-2.7%) were blind, while another 27 (2.4%) and 62 (5.5%) subjects had severe visual impairment (<6/60-3/60) and visual impairment (<6/18-6/60), respectively. Women, as compared to men, had a higher prevalence of visual impairment and severe visual impairment; but they had a lower prevalence of blindness (1.6 vs. 2.2%); however, the difference was not statistically significant (0.6%; 95% CI: -0.9-2.1%). Similarly farmers had the highest prevalence of blindness. The leading cause of blindness and low vision was cataract, which accounted for 14 of 21 (66.6%) cases of blindness and 49 of 89 (55.5%) cases of low vision. The second leading cause of blindness was uncorrected aphakia. Conclusion: Much of the blindness was due to unoperated cataract and uncorrected aphakia. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop ways in which cataract surgical output could be increased, and glasses provided to those who need them.

We examine specialization and the conditions under which it occurred for resin production from agroforests in Pesisir Sumatra using data from 223 households. Households with agroforests enjoyed incomes 26% higher than average. Comparison of two villages suggests specialization was associated with access to markets, less suitable land for wet rice cultivation and reliance on damar income for purchasing food staples. In contrast to findings elsewhere, Krui farmers specialized using low value products and minimum inputs. The cultivation of damar in low maintenance agroforests yielded attractive returns.

The paper broadens the discussion on poverty and poverty measurement by examining the prevalence of relative poverty in Pakistan. Based on the moderate relative consumption poverty line of Rs 775 per capita per month, the prevalence of relative poverty was at 40.7 percent in 2001-02. On the other hand, half of the population was below the income-based moderate relative poverty line, implying that 77.5 million individuals were poor in Pakistan. At the province level, the results suggest the highest prevalence of urban poverty in the NWFP, followed by Sindh, Balochistan, and Punjab. On the other hand, rural Sindh was the poorest region in the country, followed by the NWFP and Balochistan. The trends implied by the concept of relative poverty suggest a more rapidly increasing trend in relative poverty because of rising income inequality. As a result, gains in income accrued to the richest at the expense of the poorest and the middle income groups, implying that the rich got richer and the poor got poorer over the last 15 year. These results suggest that adverse distributional outcome may be due to the pursuance of stabilisation and adjustment programmes within the framework of the ""Washington Consensus"" which put too much emphasis on removing macroeconomic imbalances and enhancing economic growth while giving no consideration to equity and poverty. While economic growth alone is not enough for poverty reduction, there is a need to raise PRSP spending in order to pursue an effective poverty reduction strategy with a focus on redistributive policies. While the country has already made a commitment to attain the Millennium Development Goals, economic policies need to be expansionary. Poverty reduction strategy should be based on the policies of building up the assets of the poor and increasing the demand for those assets. An expansion of health and education for the low-income households and measures that increase the relative prices of agricultural commodities and the wages of unskilled labour should be part of new poverty reduction strategy. Focusing on agrarian strategies, especially those also favouring rural industrialisation, can lead to more egalitarian growth. Rapid expansion of labour-intensive exports may contribute to faster growth in employment. Policies to support this should favour labour-intensive techniques, e.g., by not subsidising capital and by securing more credit for small enterprises.",,"income distribution; poverty; poverty alleviation; socioeconomic conditions; Asia; Eurasia; Pakistan; South Asia","Anwar, T.; UNDP, , Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

A large proportion of the literate population is concentrated in the national and provincial capitals. In general, Sindh lags behind in case of rural areas and NWFP in case of females. The analyses also indicate that the areas that are backward in terms of economic development are also those with low levels of literacy. Balochistan is the province that needs the greatest attention. An encouraging sign is the general decline in disparities in literacy levels over time. Moreover, the least literate areas have shown a significant improvement over time.

We compared productivity of kayu putih tree plantations among three different sites in East, Central, and West Java, Indonesia. Leaf-twig, and branch production per tree differed significantly among the three sites. Tree biomass production was highest at the site in West Java practicing tumpangsari (a form of shifting cultivation) of kayu putih with rice (Oryza sativa) on alluvial soils. Tree biomass production was lowest at the site in East Java, practicing tumpangsari of kayu putih with maize (Zea mays) and cassava (Mani- hot esculenta). At this site, tree biomass production increased with increasing stand age and low production was compensated by greater biomass yield of companion crops. Intermediate tree biomass production was observed at the site in Central Java where intercropping is only practiced for the first two years after plantation establishment. Production of tree biomass and kayu putih oil did not increase with increasing stand density, indicating that at a given site, high tree stocking did not lead to high production. Stand-level productivity of the plantations increased with increasing stand age and maximum productivity was attained at 15 to 35 years, after which productivity declined.

Research applicable to their sustainable use is largely lacking. We analyze the effects of different harvesting patterns on the population ecology of two highly threatened Himalayan medicinal plants, Nardostachys grandiflora (Valerianaceae) and Neopicrorhiza scrophulariiflora (Scrophulariaceae), in Shey-Phoksundo National Park and in its buffer zone in northwestern Nepal. We first documented local harvesting approaches of two major user groups, amchi (traditional doctors trained in Tibetan medicine), who harvest plants in a selective manner for local health care purposes, and commercial collectors, who harvest unselectively and at much higher intensity for trade. We then applied the selective harvesting approach of amchi in an experiment to test the effects of different harvesting levels on the population ecology of these two species. These experiments revealed a positive effect of low harvesting levels on plant density, but recruitment and survival rates decreased with increasing harvesting levels. We also analyzed the effect of high harvesting pressure for trade on the population ecology of N. grandiflora. Recruitment and survival rates were higher in N. scrophulariiflora than in N. grandiflora; the latter species is more vulnerable to harvesting than the former. The difference between them in sustainability of harvest is related to differences in their strategies of vegetative reproduction and in harvesting practices associated with these strategies.

Material and methods: A retrospective study was conducted in District Headquarter Hospital Karak from February 2002 to October 2002. Fifty Eight cases of coalmine workers who showed evidence of pneumoconiosis, were collected from the hospital OPD. Some individuals presented as patients while some were their attendants who showed radiological changes of coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP). History, clinical examination and past investigations were collected. They were also investigated in the hospital with X-ray chest, sputum examination and blood cytology with ESR. Results: Seven (12%) workers were found to be asymptomatic with X-ray chest findings of simple coal worker pneumoconiosis (CWP). Their average duration of work was 10.5 years ranging from 2 to 20 years. Forty (69%) workers were symptomatic of cough and breathlessness with X-ray chest findings of simple CWP. Eleven (19%) workers were having complicated coal worker pneumoconiosis or progressive massive fibrosis (PMF). All were symptomatic of productive cough, black sputum and breathlessness. All were past workers with their average duration of work of 25 years ranging from 18 to 35 years. Their average time to leave the work was 10 years. Smokers showed 40% prevalence of progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) versus 14.5% in nonsmokers. Seven (12%) patients used antituberculous drugs without clinical and radiological improvement. Out of 33 past workers 8(13.7%) left the work because of CWP. Conclusions: Patients with simple CWP may remain asymptomatic for long time and so remain able to perform mine work while the patients with PMF are mostly symptomatic and are not able for work in the mine. CWP may closely resemble tuberculosis so occupational history is important in suspected cases. This study found no signs of reversibility in CWP after leaving the work, rather showed progression in the cases of PMF.","Coal workers pneumoconiosis; Progressive massive fibrosis; Smoking","tuberculostatic agent; adult; aged; anamnesis; article; clinical examination; coal worker; coughing; disease severity; dyspnea; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; human; lung fibrosis; major clinical study; male; medical practice; occupational hazard; occupational lung disease; Pakistan; pneumoconiosis; retrospective study; smoking; sputum analysis; symptomatology; thorax radiography; tuberculosis; work disability","Shah, N.; Department of Medicine, , Karak, Pakistan",,,10135472,,,,"English","J.

Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted on outdoor patients in Medical OPD of District Headquarter (DHQ) Hospital, Daggar from January 1998 to December 2002. Patients and Methods: A total of 16,400 patients of age between (15-70 years), who attended the outpatients department of Medical Unit at DHQ, Daggar with non-specific symptoms of dyspepsia, heart burn, bloating, generalized body aches and pain in right hypochondrium were screened for anti-HCV anti-bodies by 3rd generation ELISA. PCR and abdominal ultrasound was also done. Standard treatment was also given. Risk factors were evaluated. Population of district was regionwise divided into sectors A-D and then into subsectors. Results: Out of 16,400 patients, 751 were found positive for anti-HCV antibodies (4.57%). The mean age of the patients was 37 years. The youngest was 15 years while the oldest was 65 years. The frequency of hepatitis C was higher among the male, 409/751 (54.46%) as compared to female, 342/751(45.53%). Hundred percent (751/751) had history of injections, 52/751 (6.92%) had major surgery, 8/751 (1.06%) had blood transfusion, 73/751 (9.72%) had dental procedure, 3/751 (0.39%) had tattooing and 332/751 (44.20%) had shaving by community barbers. The highest prevalence of hepatitis C was found in sector A1(9.7%) and the lowest in sector D3(0.5%). Conclusion: Hepatitis C is a common health problem in District Buner, and needs proper attention to alleviate the suffering of the people. It is essential to assess the magnitude of the problem, which will help us in understanding the dynamic of its transmission for control and prevention.","Anti hepatitis C antibodies; Buner; Frequency","virus antibody; adolescent; adult; aged; antibody screening; article; bloating; blood transfusion; controlled study; dental care; dyspepsia; echography; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; frequency analysis; hairdresser; heartburn; hepatitis C; human; infection control; injection; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease; outpatient care; Pakistan; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; risk factor; sex difference; social class; surgery; symptomatology; tattooing; virus transmission; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C Antibodies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Prevalence","Muhammad, N.Village and P.O.

In the study area, due to the extremely dry climate and the erratic nature of rainfall, only about 20% of people undertake rainfed agriculture with the result that forests are under tremendous pressure from cattle grazing and Fire. Unsustainable harvesting and collection of NTFPs has reduced their availability in the natural forest, which is threatening the livelihood of the tribal collectors. This paper is an outcome of three years of action research implemented with the local community at Sheopur District of Madhya Pradesh. Community awareness generation, science and technology application for NTFP processing and value addition and capacity building were the key approaches for rural livelihood and income generation. The case study emphasises the activities required for sustainable NTFP management.","Dry tropical forest; NTFP; Rural development; Tribal livelihood","deciduous forest; forest management; forest resource; income; living resource; nontimber forest product; rural development; sustainable forestry; Asia; Eurasia; India; Madhya Pradesh; South Asia; Bos taurus","Bhattacharya, P.; Faculty, Forestry and Ecosystem Management, P.O.

We compare the population dynamics of the understory bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae, between old-growth and secondary rainforests in Southeast Mexico. A. magdalenae is a non-timber forest product (NTFP), the ramets of which are harvested from wild populations to make forest plantations. The fates of 600 rosettes in the two forest types were monitored over 3 years to build annual transition matrices. Population projections using the matrices show that secondary forest populations have finite rates of growth significantly higher than those of old-growth populations under both ramet-harvest and no-harvest conditions. Life table response experiments indicate that differences in the capacity for re-growth after harvest was due to greater vegetative reproduction of the largest secondary forest rosettes and faster growth of their ramets. For understory NTFP such as A. magdalenae, secondary forests may offer more economic incentive and greater potential for forest conservation than old-growth forests. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Condor Bioreserve, certain species of such plants are commercially valuable while others are endangered. People are extracting these NTFPs from the Bioreserve, yet the magnitude and frequency of such extraction is unknown. This paper examines how the three groups of land users that have been identified by The Nature Conservancy-colonists, indigenous peoples, and hacienda owners-may utilize NTFPs. Understanding the role that these plants play in the lives of its collectors is imperative for designing effective strategies to alleviate pressure that extraction may place on the Condor Bioreserve ecosystems. Data on who harvests NTFPs, which plant parts they use, what quantities they harvest, and harvest frequency must be complemented by insight into how each group benefits from these activities. Moreover, an unbiased approach must examine how NTFP extraction may enhance certain ecosystems in addition to ways in which it may hurt Bioreserve resource ecosystems. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

The most commonly used such products are wild spinaches, fuelwood, wooden utensils edible fruits, grass hand-brushes, and twig hand-brushes, used by 85% or more of households. More than half the households investigated also make use of edible insects, wood for construction, bushmeat, wild honey and reeds for weaving. Individual households may exploit dozens of animal and plant species. The range in annual, direct-use values is large, from less than R1000 per household per year to over R12 000. The value to rural households is manifest through a daily net function which represents a cost saving to the families involved and to the state, as well as through an emergency net, which serves as an insurance in times of misfortune, such as drought, disease, and unexpected economic hardship. The emergency net function has hardly been quantified in South Africa and internationally. Ad hoc trade in NTFPs is a common emergency net, which in some instances evolves into a permanent way of life. Financial returns from trade are variable, depending on resource type and hours worked, but are typically low. Despite the small cash incomes from trade, they provide an important contribution that complement the diverse livelihood strategies within a household, especially for the poorer sectors of rural society. Moreover, there are non-financial benefits of NTFP trade that are commonly overlooked.",,"household income; natural resource; nontimber forest product; rural economy; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World; Animalia; Hexapoda; Insecta","Shackleton, C.; Department of Environmental Science, , Grahamstown 6140, South Africa; email: c.shackleton@ru.ac.za",,,00382353,,SAJSA,,"English","S.

Design: Descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: Medical Unit, DHQ Hospital, Daggar, District Buner, NWFP, Pakistan, from January 1999 to June 2002. Patients and Methods: Three hundreds and fifty consecutive non-cirrhotic, chronic hepatitis C patients with positive HCV anti bodies by 3rd generation ELISA, positive HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and raised serum alanine amino transferase (ALT) were evaluated and treated with combination of interferon alfa 2-b three million units subcutaneously three injection weekly and ribavirin 800-1200 mg orally daily for 24 weeks and followed for another 6 months. The HCV RNA was checked after 12 weeks and at the end of the treatment. The ALT level was checked after 04 weeks, at 12 weeks, and at the end of the treatment. End of the treatment viral response, sustained viral response and side effects of therapy were noted. Results: Normal ALT was observed in 260 (74.2%) of the patients after one month of treatment and 310 (88.5%) of the patients at the end of 03 months. HCR RNA was not detectable in 275 (78.5%) of the patients at the end of 03 months (12 weeks of treatment). At the end of 24 weeks of treatment the HCV RNA was not detectable in 298 (85.14%) patients. Two hundred and seventy-six (78.85%) of the patients had persistently normal ALT and HCV RNA in the six months' follow up after treatment. Conclusion: Combination treatment of interferon and ribavirin for 24 weeks produced 88.57% biochemical and 85.14% virological response.

This is a major human rights issue that has received little attention outside of human rights groups and women activist networks. This paper provides a critical reassessment of honour killings in Pakistan and argues that the prevalence of honour killings is due to the fact that traditional justice prevails over jural law. Since the late 1970s, aspects of traditional justice have been incorporated in the Pakistan Penal Code, thereby sanctioning homicide of men and women charged with adultery and fornication. In order to analyse the tenuous relationship between jural law and traditional justice, this paper is based on first-hand accounts of honour killings in the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). This actor-oriented approach shows why traditional justice sanctions honour killings and the inability of jural law and the judiciary to punish offenders. In order to deter honour killings, more strident punishment of offenders is advised to invalidate traditional justice and counteract the private use of violence.",,"homicide; human rights; social justice; violence; Asia; Eurasia; North-West Frontier; Pakistan; South Asia","Knudsen, A.; Chr.

The duration of illness was from 3-32 weeks. A skin biopsy was performed from the most typical lesion from each patient. The biopsy slide was stained with H&E stain and viewed under a microscope by a single expert. The histopathological findings were noted in accordance to uniform criteria. Results: The confirmation of the diagnosis was done by the detection of amastigotes (LT bodies) in the slides. They were detected in 11 out of 36 patients (30.55%). The other most significant finding detected in all the slides was the presence of a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate in the superficial dermis. Conclusion: It is concluded that the chances of picking up of amastigotes in the biopsy slides in not high.

Objectives: To find out the proportion of the families using iodized salt, iodine contents of the salts used by the families, urinary iodine levels in school children and the effect on goitre prevalence in Swat selected as a model district in 1998. Subject & Methods: The study was conducted in 960 children of both sexes, age 8-10 years in primary schools of district Swat in the year 2000. A replicate model used for base line study in 1998 was adopted. The students were clinically examined for goitre using palpation method. 960 edible salt samples for its iodine content and 240 urine samples for iodine level were analysed. Results: The overall goitre prevalence was found to be 52 and 45% in boys and girls respectively. 23% salt samples were found un-iodized, while in 25.6% the iodine content was less than 7ppm. The results revealed 18% decrease in total goitre rate and 35% increase in the use of iodized salt from the base line survey conducted in 1998, in school children of district Swat. Conclusions: The study revealed that since the area of Swat is still highly endemic for Iodine Deficiency Disorders, sustained efforts are required to ensure 100% salt iodization.","Goitre; IDD; School Children; Universal salt iodization","iodine; iodized salt; unclassified drug; article; condiment; endemic disease; female; food composition; goiter; health program; health survey; human; iodination; iodine content; iodine deficiency; iodine deficiency disorder; major clinical study; male; Pakistan; prevalence; salt iodization; school child; universal salt iodization; urinalysis; urine level","Akhtar, T.; PMRC Research Centre, , Peshawar, Pakistan; email: tasleemkmc@yahoo.com",,,1682024X,,PJMSC,,"English","Pak.

As ethnic Lao settlements are located along the river, many households engage in non-agricultural activities. Khmu settlements are located throughout the whole region, with agriculture as the main activity of most households. Hmong settlements are located only in mountainous areas; almost all households have both rice farming and opium poppy cultivation as main farming activities. The most important activity contributing to cash income is NTFP gathering. A large quantity of NTFPs is grown as secondary vegetation after burning the forest for swidden agriculture. The most notable of these is the styrax tree (Styrax tonkinensis) which produces a balsamic resin known as benzoin. As a regeneration of styrax trees is performed in combination with swidden agriculture, this land use system of combined benzoin gathering and swidden agriculture is comparable to the concept of an agro-forestry. This type of forest use has long been practiced in the study area. However, the present study shows that this agro-forestry mode of forest use, or indigenous sustainable forest use system, is at risk of collapse, due to political regulations against forest utilization.","Agro-forestry; Benzoin; Fallowed swidden; Non-timber forest product (NTFP); Northern Laos; Styrax tonkinensis","agroforestry; ethnicity; forest resource; mountain region; nontimber forest product; resin; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Laos; Southeast Asia; World","Satoshi, Y.; Department of Regional Science, 2-40-1, Kurokami, Kumamoto City, Kumamoto 860-8555, Japan; email: yokoyama@kumamoto-u.ac.jp",,,05638682,,,,"English","Southeast Asian Stud.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244271598

In India over 50 million people are believed to be directly dependent upon NTFPs for their subsistence. However, such human dependence on NTFPs for livelihood gains (win) has most frequently been at a certain ecological cost (lose). If livelihoods are to be maintained, the existing 'win-lose' settings have to be steered to a 'win-win' mode, otherwise, there could be severe erosion of the biological resources and loss of livelihoods ('lose-lose'). Examining the dependence of forest fringe communities on NTFPs at three sites in south India with contrasting human and ecological settings, three key factors (extent of dependence on NTFPs, indigenous ecological knowledge and market organization) are likely to constrain reaching the win-win situation. How these factors shape the ecological cost of harvesting NTFPs at the three sites is examined. Within the parameter space of these factors, it is possible to predict outcomes and associations that will conform to win-win or win-lose situations. Empirical data derived from the three study sites demonstrate the causality of the observed associations. The key for long-term livelihood gains lies in reducing the ecological cost. Certain interventions and recommendations that could optimize the balance between livelihood gains and ecological cost are proposed.","Ecological costs; Ecological knowledge; Livelihood gains; Non-timber forest product; NTFP; Western Ghats; Win-win situation","Biodiversity; Cost benefit analysis; Data acquisition; Ecology; Erosion; Harvesting; Marketing; Parameter estimation; Ecological costs; Ecological settings; Livelihood gains; Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Forestry; community resource management; forest resource; harvesting; nontimber forest product; article; ecology; economic development; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental protection; forest; harvesting; India; marketing; profit; vegetation; Biodiversity; Costs; Data Processing; Ecosystems; Erosion; Forest Products; Harvesting; Marketing; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; India; South Asia; World","Uma Shaanker, R.; Ashoka Trust Res.

Methods: A cross sectional study design was used for this purpose: Ten health care facilities were selected from each province keeping appropriate representation from first level health facilities, district health facilities and tertiary care hospital. Analysis of selected indicators was carried out on the basis of provinces, health facilities, gender and different age groups. Results: Documentation of 914 responses was completed from three provinces. Almost equal distribution of encounters was maintained representing different health facilities. Forty seven percent of encounters involved children under 15 years of age. Female patients comprised of 56% and the mean age of the entire sample was 26 years. The mean dispensing time was only 38 seconds, the mean consultation time was 1.79 minutes and the average number of drugs per prescription turned out to be 2.7 out of which only 1.6 drugs were being dispensed from the facility. More than half of the prescriptions contained antibiotics and 15% of patients were prescribed with injectables. Only half of the patients expressed satisfaction with their visit to health facility.

However, such statistics do not yet exist for most countries, neither is the already available data comparable among countries. Under a joint European Commission-Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) partnership programme in support to sustainable forest management in Africa, Asia and Latin America, the NWFP Programme of FAO has developed a standard reporting format to assist countries in recording statistics on the production and trade of major NWFP. This approach was used in order to compile NWFP country profiles for all countries of Latin America, Caribbean, Africa, Near East and Asia. The result of this global assessment has been published as a separate chapter of the Forest Resources Assessment 2000 (FAO 2001). From the lessons learned by implementing this global survey, specific case studies to improve NWFP data gathering methodologies were carried out in selected African and Caribbean countries (Suriname, Cameroon, and Madagascar). The results of the case studies were analysed and recommendations for improved NWFP data gathering methodologies were formulated.","Methodologies; Non-wood forest products; Production; Statistics; Trade","forest management; forestry production; methodology; nontimber forest product; sustainability; Apogon brachygrammus","Killmann, W.; U.N.F.A.O., Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, Rome 00100, Italy",,,00929654,,,,"English","Gen.

However, methodologies for the precise assessment of forest resources yielding non-wood forest products (NWFP) are not yet sufficiently elaborated, neither can they be easily implemented by resource managers in the field. Under a joint European Commission-FAO partnership programme supporting sustainable forest management in African countries, inventory methodologies and experiences for assessing non wood forest resources were reviewed and analysed through 2 sub-regional expert consultation meetings covering dry to humid forest ecosystems. In these workshops, specific NWFP life forms (such as fruits, bark, lianas, leaves, roots) were identified for the elaboration and field testing of inventory protocols. They include assessment methodologies for: bark (johimbe, Pausinystalia johimbe in Cameroon); wild mushrooms (various species in Malawi); quinquéliba leaves (Combretum micranthum in Benin); baobab fruits (Adansonia digitata in Kenya); and leaves of the liana Gnetum buchholzianum in Central African Republic. For each NWFP life form, a specific inventory protocol was designed and tested. The results of the field work were analysed and improved inventory protocols were formulated for each selected NWFP. The results of these field studies and the improved inventory methodologies for the selected NWFP will be published as a practical field manual of generic NWFP assessment guidelines for use by resource managers.","Africa; Inventory; Methodology; Non-wood forest products","forest management; forestry production; inventory; methodology; nontimber forest product; sustainability; Africa; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata; Basidiomycota; Combretum; Gnetum; Gnetum buchholzianum; Pausinystalia; Pausinystalia johimbe","Killmann, W.; Forest Products Division, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, Rome 00100, Italy",,,00929654,,,,"English","Gen.

The harvest of wild non-timber forest products (NTFP) represents an important source of income to millions of people world-wide. Despite growing concern over the conservation of these species, as well as their potential to foster forest conservation, information on the ecological implications of harvest is available only in disparate case studies. 2. Seventy studies that quantify the ecological effects of harvesting NTFP from plant species were reviewed, with the aims of assessing the current state of knowledge and drawing lessons that can provide guidelines for management as well as better directing future ecological research in this area. 3. The case studies illustrated that NTFP harvest can affect ecological processes at many levels, from individual and population to community and ecosystem. However, the majority of research was focused at a population level and on a limited subset of plant parts that are harvested. 4. Tolerance to harvest varies according to life history and the part of plant that is harvested. Moreover, the effects of harvest for any one species are mediated by variation in environmental conditions over space and time, and by human management practices. 5. In order to withstand heavy harvest, specific management practices in addition to gathering are necessary for many NTFP species. Management practices can be carried out at different spatial scales and some are highly effective in fostering population persistence. 6. Synthesis and applications. Substantial advances have been made towards identifying the ecological impacts of NTFP harvest. However, there is a need for longer-term studies that focus on multiple ecological levels (ranging from genes to ecosystems), that assess the mechanisms underlying impacts and that validate current models. Researchers and forest managers need to work with local harvesters in designing and evaluating management practices that can mitigate the negative effects of harvest.","Conservation; Extraction; Harvest; Matrix models; Non-timber forest products; Resource management; Review; Sustainable development","conservation management; ecological impact; harvesting; nontimber forest product; resource management; sustainable development; Miletinae","Ticktin, T.; Department of Botany, 3190 Maile Way, Honolulu, HI 96822, United States; email: Ticktin@hawaii.edu",,,00218901,,JAPEA,,"English","J.

Of the 20 species, five were used in handicraft production, 11 yielded human foods, and 11 had medicinal uses. In addition, many tree species have multipurpose value: six of the 20 species were recorded to be food producers in addition to having uses for handicraft production and/or medicine. The contribution of herbaceous species to the NTFPs used and harvested during the dry season is negligible.

Confronted with severe poverty arising from small landholdings and scarce nonfarming employment opportunities, villagers in the upper portion of the watershed have benefited considerably from the income derived from NTFPs. Findings indicate that various components of a common forest resource can be managed differently and undergo degradation at different rates. NTFPs are undergoing degradation more seriously than timber under both government and community forest management systems. However, NTFP degradation is more serious in government forests than in community forests. Such degradation is due primarily to a lack of proper institutional arrangements, including the lack of a comprehensive government policy framework for sustainable use and management of NTFPs. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Common forest resource; Community forests; Forest user groups; Government forest; Nepal; Nontimber forest product collection practice; Watershed","forest management; nontimber forest product; poverty; resource depletion; rural economy; sustainability; Asia; Eurasia; Nepal; South Asia","Pandit, B.H.; Nepal Agroforestry Foundation, PO Box 9594, Kathmandu, Nepal",,,08941920,,,,"English","Soc.

They have been classified as having either subsistence consumption or commercial values. These values are mostly related to their utilitarian functions, but recent studies show that NTFPs also hold strong cultural functions. Such cultural functions can play a role in both rural and urban livelihoods; consequently the values of NTFPs may be related to both utilitarian and cultural functions.

Box 5014, As, N-1432, Norway","In west Africa, the alarming rate of land use intensification and the assumed deterioration of parkland species calls for assessments of locally valued non-timber forest product (NTFP) yielding populations. This study focused on the baobab tree, Adansonia digitata Linn., in Cinzana, Mali. Here by conducting biological inventories in different land use types and interviews we addressed the following central questions. (1) How does the harvesting of baobab NTFPs in different land use types (fallow, cropland, and village (habitation) areas) affect the viability of its population? (2) By which ways do humans, other than by harvesting, affect the viability of the population? The viability of a population is, in this study, treated as a characteristic that is determined by the mature population size and its regeneration potential (recruit population). Baobab products in Cinzana are used on a regular basis and valued in a cultural context, like in many parts of west Africa. For the local society, the sustained viability of the baobab populations is therefore essential. Fruit harvesting has an impact on dispersal and establishment, while leaf harvesting causes mutilation that reduces the number of fruits on each tree. Mutilation was more severe in cropland than in fallows, and cropland individuals were most prone to damages from plowing and livestock. The baobab populations were, however, more dense and comprised more recruits, in cropland and village areas compared to fallows, and seedlings were in fact not found in fallow. These differences are explained by management practices related to the land use type. In addition to the differences in baobab density and population structure between cropland and fallows, the weak correlation between density of recruits and mature individuals testifies to the importance of the specific ecological role that humans play in baobab dispersal and establishment. Clearly, harvesting is not the only way by which humans influence the viability of baobab populations. Some practices are beneficial, either intentional (e.g. seedling protection, transplanting) or unintentional (e.g. dispersal of seeds in garbage), while others are detrimental (e.g. livestock browsing, plowing). At present local management practices contribute to sustain the viability of the species. The results point to the fact that the baobab population is not declining but in need of management that secures the maintenance of a genetically diverse population. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Pervez Musharraf, who seized control of the Pakistani government in a 1999 military coup, delivered a major address to the nation-and to the world at large. Mindful of Pakistan's designation by the global media as a crucial front in the US ""war on terrorism,"" Musharraf promised to curtail the activities of radical Islamist groups and to reform the curricula of the Islamic schools (madrassas) that had become infamous worldwide as incubators of the Taliban. In this speech, the general positioned himself as the moderate Muslim ruler who had heeded the wishes of the silent majority in Pakistan that is against fanatical Islam. When, four months later, Musharraf anointed himself president by calling a referendum of questionable legality, the State Department brushed aside widespread complaints of ballot stuffing and other fraud by pointing to the parliamentary elections planned for that October. But there was great surprise in Pakistan and abroad when, in those elections, a newly formed coalition of Islamist political parties, Muttahida. Majlis-e Amal (MMA), won a plurality of votes in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan. The MMA won a total of 45 National Assembly seats, as well as 49 of the 99 seats in the NWFP provincial assembly and 13 of the 51 seats in the Baluchistan house. The MMA's success hints at the possibility that Pashtun nationalism, at least in the 2002 elections, was represented to a large degree through the idiom of Islam. Of course, there were elements of anti-Americanism as well, but cross-border Pashtun solidarity also played a significant role. In interviews for this article, MMA leaders expressed confidence that their party was the best guarantee against the ultra-nationalist Pashtun sentiments that seek to break away from the federation. They said that the party seeks a stable political environment to accomplish its startegic agenda of creating a ""true"" Islamic republic. Ghafoor Ahmed, one of five lieutenants to the leader of the Jamaat-e Eslami (JI), a major constituent party of the MMA (see box, stated that the alliance is committed to the geographical integrity of Pakistan, yet if people are pushed to the wall then even the MMA will not be able to contain separatism. The onus, Ahmed says, will be on the Musharaff regime. Rhetorical guarantees against Islamist and ethnic radicalism may be bargaining positions in the MMA's evolving relationship with Musharraf and the military.",,"education; election; Islamism; military government; national politics; terrorism; Asia; Eurasia; Pakistan; South Asia","Ali, K.A.; University of Texas-Austin, Austin, TX, United States",,"Middle East Research and Information Project",08992851,,,,"English","Middle East Rep.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242885229

The causes of rural poverty are complex and multidimensional. The rural poor are quite diverse both in the problems they face, and the possible solutions to these problems are also different. The paper uses the most recent household data set available - PIHS 2001-02 - to examine the causes of rural poverty, as to what accounts for its persistence and what policy measures should be taken to alleviate it. Poverty estimates using official poverty line suggest the high prevalence of rural poverty ranging from 39 percent to 48 percent in all provinces. Rural poverty is found to be strongly correlated with lack of asset in rural areas. The unequal land ownership in the country is found to be one of the major causes of rural poverty, as poverty level was the highest among the landless households followed by non-agriculture households. The incidence of landlessness is common in rural areas. About 67 percent households own no land in the country. Unusually, just 0.3 percent households own 55 and above acres of land across the country, suggesting a highly skewed landownership pattern. Gini Coefficient of landholding suggests that Punjab has the most unequal landownership pattern, followed by the NWFP, Sindh, and Balochistan. The highly unequal land distribution seems to have resulted in tenancy arrangements such as sharecropping, resulting in high prevalence of absolute poverty particularly in Sindh. A broad-based land reform programme, including land redistribution and fair and enforceable tenancy contracts together with rural public works programmes and access to credit, is critical to reducing rural poverty in Pakistan.",,"land reform; landownership; poverty alleviation; rural area; Asia; Eurasia; Pakistan; South Asia","Anwar, T.; Research Department, , Karachi, Pakistan",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

The long, slender leaves are either used fresh or dried and dyed for use in the floral industries in the United States and Europe. Our objectives were to develop a better understanding of beargrass production under different tree canopy (overstory) densities in the Pacific silver fir/big huckleberry/beargrass and the mountain hemlock/big huckleberry/beargrass plant associations in and around the Cispus Adaptive Management Area. We examined differences in beargrass production for different overstory canopy conditions on 10 sites in each association. Results indicated that beargrass quality is not of commercial grade under open canopies (<60% overstory density). For medium and high densities, the interaction between plant association and overstory density was significant for all response variables except harvestable dry mass. Harvestable dry mass of beargrass did not differ between the two associations, but was greater under medium- compared with high-density conditions. For the Pacific silver fir association, the high-overstory-density class had greater basal area of beargrass per site, and plants were larger with longer leaves compared to medium-canopy-density sites. We did not find this relationship for the mountain hemlock association, except for the longest leaf variable. It is unclear why basal area and size of beargrass were more closely related to overstory conditions for the Pacific silver fir association. Evaluation of the sustainability of beargrass as a nontimber forest product will require long-term study of the relationships among environmental variables, beargrass productivity, and beargrass population dynamics. © 2004 by the Society of American Foresters.","Beargrass; Nontimber forest products; NTFP; Overstory/understory relationships","Color; Environmental engineering; Harvesting; Inspection; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Beargrass; Canopy density; Nontimber forest products; Overstory relationhip; Understory relationship; Forestry; Color; Forest Canopy; Forest Products; Forestry; Harvesting; Inspection; Over Story; Plants; Under Story; Abies; Abies amabilis; Conium; Conium maculatum; Tsuga mertensiana; Xerophyllum tenax","Blatner, K.; Department of Natural Res.

We investigated the demography and population dynamics of the harvested, understory palm, Chamaedorea radicalis in the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. Our objectives were: (1) to describe patterns of C. radicalis abundance and population size structure, (2) to document C. radicalis demography, (3) to test experimentally how this demography was affected by different leaf harvest regimes and livestock browse intensities, and (4) to project their effects on transient and long-term population dynamics. Data on palm abundance and population size structure were collected from belt-transects along hillsides. We also exposed 100 adult palms to each of five leaf harvest treatments (N = 500): control, harvest once per year, harvest twice per year, harvest four times per year, and a modified four times per year harvest where only one leaf was removed each harvest. Browse experiments were conducted to assess the effect of burro browse on demography. Experiments were monitored over two years, and results were incorporated with other demographic data to parameterize stage-based (Lefkovitch) matrices for each year x treatment combination. Topographic position influenced both population size structure and density, with a gradient from valleys (727 palms/ha) to upper slopes (5513 palms/ha). Palm demography was characterized by low mortality, low reproductive activity, and high seed germination rates. Leaf harvest increased adult mortality and reduced fecundity, and it was projected to reduce λ (finite rate of increase). However, λ for harvested populations did not differ significantly from 1. Browsing increased mortality of seedlings, juveniles, and small adults, resulting in populations projected to decline (λ < 1). These findings indicate that browsing by free-range livestock impacts C. radicalis populations more than leaf harvest and could explain the low density and skewed size structure in valleys. The modest impact of leaf harvest treatments is due in part to the reduction in the availability of marketable leaves. Detection of such feedbacks exemplifies how the incorporation of human management practices enhances the insights that experiments bring to studies of the population ecology of NTFPs.","Chamaedorea radicalis; El Cielo; Lefkovitch matrix; Livestock browse; Mexico; Non-timber forest products; Palm; Plant demography; Population dynamics; Sustainable harvest","browsing; ecological impact; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; understory; El Cielo Biosphere Reserve; Mexico [North America]; North America; Tamaulipas; Chamaedorea; Macoma; Macoma balthica; Macoma balthica","Endress, B.A.; Department of Forest Science, 1401 Gekeler Lane, La Grande, OR 97850, United States; email: bryan.endress@oregonstate.edu",,"Ecological Society of America",10510761,,ECAPE,,"English","Ecol.

The study was based mainly on the previous studies. The data from different Agricultural Censuses were used to profile the pattern of land distribution and land use. The major findings of the study are briefly summarised. First, the relationship between farm size and productivity measured through the profit frontier approach or through simple regression equation between farm size and production per acre is found to vary between different studies. The inverse relationship between farm size and output per acre is a recurrent feature found in data. This is apparently due to land-labour interactions. Small farmers have a lower opportunity cost of labour, can exploit more marginal land, cultivate a larger proportion of their land and as a result achieve higher output and yields. On the other hand, small farmers are more credit-constrained and large farmers less so. A low effective price of capital for large farmers leads to substitution of machines for labour. The large farmers use capital intensive inputs. Depending on which effect is dominant, one can get inverse relationship, positive relationship or a U-shaped curve. The review of studies provides examples of each relationship. One needs to be cautious in drawing public policy implications for land reforms of the redistributive type. The impact of land distribution on production and equity would depend on the complementary policies for the supply of modern inputs and their interface with the land distribution. Second, the importance of secure titles to land as well as protection of the tenants for their prescribed share in inputs and outputs is obvious. However, we did not find much empirical work on these aspects in Pakistan. The importance of share-cropping as the most preferred farm of tenancy emerges clearly from the data. The literature on factors responsible for this result is patchy, however. Third, the participation in land market is by and large excluded for tenants, landless and small farmers. These groups are excluded from the land market due to severe credit constraints they face to buy land. They do not have enough savings of their own and do not have suitable collateral to pledge for getting access to credit. Insecurity of land tenure arrangements and almost zero probability of buying land has reduced this segment of rural population to be condemned to the lower strata in rural areas. The only course left for them is to turn to the labour market - with or without skill development or to engage in activities like animal raising which are not land-based but are labour-intensive for the landless households. Fourth, the concentration of land was high at the time of creation of Pakistan. Despite few attempts at land distribution, the Gini coefficient for ownership holdings has gone up from 0.66 in 1972 to 00.75 in 2000. It has increased for the provinces of Punjab and NWFP considerably but has shown a modest decline in Sindh and Balochistan. This outcome is due to the unequalising nature of land distribution through private land market. Fifth, misguided land reforms which had fixed a ceiling on land holdings and the lowering of this ceiling over time in three land reforms of 1959, 1972 and 1977 had made tenancy unattractive to land owners. Land was split between members of the family to avoid giving land to government and land previously sharecropped was resumed by landlords for self-cultivation. This was accompanied by capital-intensive farming resulting in lesser employment opportunities for landless labour. Last but not the least, the study spells out the key aspects of the nature of land market in Pakistan's context. In view of the fact that the ongoing interest rate is generally higher than the rate of return on land investment as long as the land is used for farming, it is not possible for the prospective farmers, without initial capital at hand, to participate in the land market. In other words, land markets are open only for those who are enjoying excess liquidity in the form of rental income. The higher growth rate of land value than productivity growth implies that the land value is no longer the discounted value of rent as postulated in the conventional theory. This land-rent relationship has assured the continuous flow of capital gains for rent receivers and continuously squeezed the rent payers out of the land market.",,"capital flow; farming system; land market; land reform; land use planning; regression analysis; rural policy; Asia; Baluchistan; Eurasia; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Sind; South Asia; Animalia","Qureshi, M.G.; Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Islamabad, Pakistan",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

The results show that conditions introduced by forest conservation programs and the spread of small-scale commercial tea cultivation are transforming the economy around Sinharaja. The process is an economically rational one where resident communities decide upon their actions based on the opportunity cost of time involved with NTFP in the absence of observable prices. Although the process, overall, has led to a decline in the role of NTFP in the household economy, its impact over different NTFP are not uniform, leaving sustained demand for certain NTFP. This situation calls for a multifaceted approach in forest management programs to address the various household needs fulfilled by NTFP-based activities.","Household demand; Household economy; Household production theory; Non-timber forest products; Opportunity cost; Sinharaja","Conservation; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Vegetation; Non-timber forest products (NTFP); Forestry; forest management; nontimber forest product; rural economy; World Heritage Site; economic aspect; environmental management; forest; forest management; household; nonhuman; review; rural area; Sri Lanka; Commerce; Conservation of Natural Resources; Data Collection; Financing, Personal; Forestry; Household Products; Humans; Rural Population; Social Conditions; Sri Lanka; Tropical Climate; Asia; Eurasia; Sabaragamuwa; Sinharaja Forest Reserve; South Asia; Sri Lanka","Senaratne, A.; Post Grad.

This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the prevalence of and identify factors associated with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection in prisoners of North West Frontier Province (NWFP). Methods. A stratified random sampling technique was used to select a sample of 425 from a total of 6607 male prisoners aged 18-60 years from the five central prisons of NWFP, Pakistan (Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Haripur, Kohat, and Mardan). The selected inmates were interviewed using a structured pre-tested questionnaire; a Mantoux tuberculin skin test (TST) was also performed. Latent MTB infection status of the prisoner was determined by the size of the induration of the TST in the presence/absence of a previous BCG scar. Results. Overall prevalence of latent MTB infection among prisoners was 48% (204/425). Using multiple logistic regression, a prisoner's age, educational level, smoking status, duration of current incarceration, and average accommodation area of 60 ft2 or less in prison barracks were found to be statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) predictors of latent MTB infection. Conclusion. The high prevalence of latent MTB infection as assessed by TST in prisoners requires immediate steps be taken to identify and confirm MTB infection, and to treat and counsel those found to be positive in this setting. Efforts to halt MTB transmission in prisons should include: routine screening of prisoners on entry using sputum smear and TST for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and latent MTB infection, respectively. The isolation and treatment of TB positive prisoners and chemo-prophylactic treatment of TST positives, reduction of overcrowding, education regarding the harmful effects of smoking, and intensive monitoring of those serving longer prison terms may help reduce the MTB transmission in this setting and in the community at large.","Cross-sectional study; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Overcrowding; Pakistan; Prisoners; Tuberculin skin test; Tuberculosis","BCG vaccine; disease prevalence; medical geography; risk factor; tuberculosis; adult; age; article; chemoprophylaxis; cigarette smoking; controlled study; crowding; disease association; disease transmission; education; health education; human; interview; logistic regression analysis; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pakistan; patient care; patient counseling; patient monitoring; prevalence; priority journal; prison; prisoner; questionnaire; randomization; risk factor; sampling; scar; screening test; sputum smear; statistical significance; treatment planning; tuberculin test; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pakistan; Prevalence; Prisoners; Prisons; Risk Factors; Smoking; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis; Pakistan","Akhtar, S.; Div. of Epidemiology/Biostatistics, Stadium Road, Karachi 74800, Pakistan; email: saeed.akhtar@aku.edu",,,03005771,,IJEPB,"14559752","English","Int.

To examine this, information was collected through a survey of 324 households, community resource assessment ranking and group discussion in a small mountain watershed of Nepal. The study analysed NTFP collection and management practices under government and community forest management systems, and impact of these practices on the status of forest and NTFPs. The analysis based on people's perception revealed that NTFPs were being depleted more rapidly than timber components in both types of forest. The pace of depletion was, however, considerably lower in community forests, as these forests were accessible only to the relevant forest user group members. Depletion of NTFPs was due primarily to the lack of proper institutional arrangements, including the lack of a comprehensive government policy framework, for sustainable use and management of NTFPs.","Common property resource; Forest management; Forest user groups; Nepal; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); NTFP collection systems; NTFP depletion","Forestry; Natural resources; Public policy; Common property resources (CPR); Environmental protection; common property resource; environmental degradation; mountain region; nature-society relations; nontimber forest product; article; degradation; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; government; household; Nepal; Nepal","Thapa, G.B.; Sch. of Environ., Resrc./Devmt.

As a result, factors affecting the sustainability of these important resources are being undermined. The aim of the paper is to examine trade in two selected NTFPs and implications for sustaining the resource base in Zimbabwe and South Africa. In eastern Zimbabwe, baobab (Adansonia digitata) bark is harvested for craft purposes, but in danger of destruction in the short term as a result of harvesting and trade arrangements. Unless appropriate harvesting and marketing mechanisms including harvesting cycles and adaptive management are adopted, the baobabs and livelihoods of humans will be threatened in the next decade. For wood products from communal woodlands in the South African study, uncontrolled trade poses danger to sustaining the natural woodlands. In both case studies, the role of non-resident NTFP dealers is a source of inevitable threat in promoting sustainable harvesting and trade. Market forces of demand and supply factors are identified as opportunities or threats and presented in a conceptualised framework. Additionally, the NTFP sector management will need to include opportunistic improvement of small-scale agropastoralism. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Baobab bark; Marketing channels; Ntfps; Southern Africa; Sustainability; Wood products","bark; craft production; forest management; harvesting; nontimber forest product; rural economy; South Africa; Zimbabwe; Adansonia; Adansonia digitata","Dovie, D.B.K.; Restoration and Conservation Biology Research Group, Wits 2050, Johannesburg, South Africa; email: delali©biology.wits.ac.za",,,13504509,,,,"English","Int.

A rapid rural appraisal approach was used to gather data from 24 NTFP stakeholders during phase I (1994) and from 37 NTFP stakeholders during phase II (2002). Phase I findings summarized the rules of access to NTFPs on private, state, tribal, and federal lands in 1994, as well as comparing the perspectives of land managers to those of pickers and buyers regarding the need for and the impacts of those rules. A preliminary diagram of NTFP knowledge exchange networks was developed from information provided by informants who participated in the 1994 study. This diagram suggested that in 1994, buyers and land managers functioned as key information exchange nodes in NTFP networks at the study site. Phase II findings indicated that the formalization of NTFP access process still nascent in 1994 had solidified sufficiently by 2002 that many pickers and buyers had come to take the permit requirements for granted. However, NTFP stakeholders noted that leases were increasingly difficult to acquire. It appears that a few larger floral greens companies based on the southeastern Olympic Peninsula now control most floral greens leases on private and state lands. By 2002, the floral greens labor market was dominated by Latinos, many of whom lacked legal work documents and thus occupied a precarious position in the labor market. To counteract the power of the larger buying companies, some of the smaller buying companies and harvesters have worked with social justice organizations to pressure the Washington State Department of Labor to enforce regulations regarding employer-contractor relations. The study has several key implications for forest managers, including the need for managers and policymakers to recognize the heterogeneity of the harvester and buyer populations and to consider the possibility that interventions in domains seemingly unrelated to forest management, such as labor policy, might constitute key elements of a sustainable forest management strategy. The report ends with a list of steps managers and researchers can take to support sustainable floral greens management.","Floral greens; Forest policy; Labor policy; Nontimber forest products; Olympic Peninsula; Resource tenure; Salal; Sustainability","access restriction; forest management; forestry policy; harvesting; labor policy; nontimber forest product; rapid rural appraisal; stakeholder; sustainability; United States; Gaultheria shallon; Miletinae","Lynch, K.A.; Institute for Culture and Ecology, PO Box 6688, Portland, OR 97208, United States",,,08874840,,,,"English","USDA For.

We report results of a rainfed rotation experiment, conducted in the Northwest Frontier Province (NWFP), Pakistan, during 1995-1999 to evaluate effects of residue retention and fertiliser N on N2 fixation inputs and yields of a mungbean (Vigna radiata)-wheat (Triticum aestivum) sequence, and a lentil (Lens culinaris)-summer cereal sequence. Mungbean and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or maize (Zea mays) were grown in the summers and lentil and wheat in the winters. Immediately after grain harvest, above-ground residues of all crops were either completely removed (-residue), or chopped into 5-20 cm pieces, spread across the plots and incorporated by chisel plough (+residue). Fertiliser N rates were nil or 120 kg N/ha for wheat and nil or 150 kg N/ha for sorghum/maize. The percentage of mungbean N derived from N2 fixation (%Ndfa) ranged from 47% to almost 100% (mean of 75%). On average, mungbean fixed 112 kg N/ha (+residues) and 74 kg N/ha (-residues), with N balances of +64 kg N/ha (+residues) and +9 kg N/ha (-residues). Lentil %Ndfa ranged from 50 to 87% (mean of 73%). Values for crop N fixed were 42-85 kg N/ha, with a mean of 68 kg N/ha. Average N balances for lentil were +27 kg N/ha (+residues) and +16 kg N/ha (-residues). Grain yields of the ON wheat responded to the previous mungbean (36% increase over the ON sorghum), but showed an even greater response to fertiliser N applied to the previous sorghum (150% increase). Highest yields were recorded for the N-fertilised wheat (average of 2.27 t/ha). Shoot biomass yields of the ON sorghum and maize responded strongly to the previous lentil crop (49% average increase over the 0N wheat) and fertiliser N, applied either to the crop itself (140%) or to the previous wheat crop (32%). Residue retention increased shoot biomass yields of both the summer (average of 20%) and winter crops (average of 9%). Grain yield benefits of residues were 13% for mungbean, and 8% for wheat and lentil. Soil organic N and total organic C, labile C and C management index (CMI), were all increased by N inputs, from both fertiliser and N2 fixation, and by retention of residues We concluded that retention of residues improves the N economy of the cropping system and enhances crop productivity through the additional N and other soil effects. The question of whether farmers who traditionally remove residues for fodder and fuel would change practices and return the residues to the soil will depend to a large extent on the relative profitability of both options. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Analysis of the factors influencing success of NTFP commercialisation has been hindered by the lack of an appropriate analytical approach for comparison of case studies. We tested and further developed a methodology recently developed by CIFOR, by examining 16 NTFP case studies in two workshops held in Mexico and Bolivia involving a variety of stakeholders involved in NTFP commercialisation. Workshop participants identified a wide range of measures by which the success of NTFP commercialisation can be defined, which included improvements in social justice, community organisation and local culture, as well as economic status. Participants then considered the factors influencing the processes involved in NTFP commercialisation: production, collection, processing, storage, transport, marketing and sale. In total 45 factors were identified that significantly limit one of the commercialisation processes. Generally product marketing and sale were found to be those processes most constraining overall success. These results illustrate how participatory methods can be of value in analysing the success of NTFP commercialisation, and how a process-based approach can provide an analytical framework for comparison of NTFP case studies.","Case studies; Commercialisation; Multivariate statistical approach; NFTPs; Stakeholders","commercialization; forestry production; nontimber forest product; participatory approach","Newton, A.C.; School of Conservation Sciences, , Poole, Dorset BH12 5BB, United Kingdom; email: anewton@bournemouth.ac.uk",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Early hopes that NTFPs would underpin rural livelihoods, and rescue rural populations from poverty while providing them with a reason to protect and manage forests, led to exaggerated claims of economic potential. They also tended to overlook the great diversity of products referred to, in terms of biological characteristics, and social and economic value, whilst simultaneously ascribing unreasonably lofty and altruistic goals to some of the world's poorest people. This overview of the contributions to this special issue of IFR points to the more sophisticated understanding of NTFP potential that has been acquired since the early 1990s. Focus on differences among NTFPs has led to literature around more specific groupings, such as 'bushmeat', 'indigenous forest fruits', or 'medicinal plants', each providing a more useful lens for assessing ways in which such products lead to sustainable rural livelihoods and forest management. However, contemplation of NTFPs as a group reminds us that forestry is a complex multi-stakeholder management system, wherein a focus on any one subset of components cannot ignore the ecological and social systems of which they form part. The methodological developments portrayed here advocate a more systemic approach, combining biological and economic approaches with NTFP users' own perceptions and knowledge within adaptive forest management, thereby side-stepping the hazards of the NTFP category.","Commercialisation; Conservation; NTFPs; Policy; Poverty alleviation; Rural livelihoods; Sustainable use","economic activity; forest management; forest resource; nontimber forest product; resource development; rural economy","Lawrence, A.; Human Ecology Programme, 5 South Parks, Oxford OX1 3UB, United Kingdom; email: anna.lawrence@eci.ox.ac.uk",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Among the most important findings is the fact that NWFPs are still a major source of food and income in many countries of the world, but few countries monitor their NWFPs systematically. Statistical data on NWFPs are incomplete, scattered or not comparable among countries, and at the national level do not yet provide a solid base for decision-making. A phased approach is suggested by addressing first those NWFPs that are of national relevance and for which monitoring and evaluation is needed for policy and forest/rural development decision-makers. Exported or widely used products in national markets should be addressed before NWFPs of minor importance or significance that are limited to a selected region. The selection of relevant NWFPs should help a country initially to focus its efforts on improved data collection. Countries can make NWFPs more visible in their existing national production and trade statistics by including specific product codes for major NWFPs into their existing national product classification system, with the aim of including them in international statistical classifications, such as the HS, in the future.","Decision-making tools; NWFP; Product classification; Trade statistics","decision making; forest resource; nontimber forest product; statistical analysis","Vantomme, P.; Wood and Non-Wood Utilisation Branch, Via Terme di Caracalla, Rome 00100, Italy; email: Paul.Vantomme@fao.org",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

While growing demands for water can be met in part by increasing the efficiency of irrigation schemes, by damming rivers, or by mining groundwater, all have financial or ecological implications. In northern Cameroon farmers produce two seasons of sorghum crop using only one rainy season and no irrigation by planting seasonally adapted varieties. Babouri is a wet season variety, picked at the end of the rainy season and Mouskouari is deep-rooted variety, planted in dry season when water is contained deep below the soil surface. This technique is appropriate for many African countries where the climatic conditions and soils are similar. Agriculture is necessary for food security in Africa, however Africa must carefully select suitable sites for irrigation construction, choose appropriate technologies and optimise the use of both new and indigenous, often low-cost approaches to mobilising water to improve crop production. Recovering and promoting traditional agricultural techniques such as dry season sorghum production can help to increase yield, conserve wetland biodiversity and utilise less water. It is also important to document and disseminate all techniques which help to minimise water use and to bare in mind that crop production is not the only way to reach food security.

Important amongst these is that because NTFPs play an important part in household incomes they can be used to raise the perceived value of forests and thus provide incentives for more sustainable use of the forest estate. However, migrant communities living around forest margins have often been perceived as groups of people most likely to take advantage of the free goods provided by forests in a way that degrades the forest environment as short term benefits are maximised over long-term sustainability. Empirical evidence from the forest zone of south-west Cameroon suggests that for many migrant communities NTFPs are not a significant part (no more than 6%) of household total income and that poorer groups seek diverse livelihood strategies that are not predicated on natural resource use. Whilst richer groups may continue to rely on sources of income from the forest and NTFPs may make up to 15% of household income, for rich and poor alike the value derived from NTFPs is generated by secondary forest and forest fallow rather than less disturbed forest that has been the focus of conservation interest. The view is put forward that forest managers and international donors interested in conservation and development need to reassess the potential contribution of NTFPs in poverty alleviation strategies, and acknowledge that forest conservation priorities of local communities require policies and management systems focused on 'sustainable systems for production of livelihood benefits' rather than protectionist approaches to areas traditionally defined as valuable forest.","Cameroon; Household income; Livelihood strategies; NTFPs; Poverty; Secondary forest","coping strategy; forest resource; household income; nontimber forest product; rural economy; Cameroon","Ambrose-Oji, B.; Centre for Arid Zone Studies, , Bangor, Gwynedd LL57 2UW, United Kingdom; email: b.ambrose-oji@bangor.ac.uk",,,14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

Reductions of water and overdrainage have influenced the yield of major crops. The impact of reduced supply at the inlet from the source, drought conditions and overdrainage from the area have lowered the groundwater to a disastrous level. Thus the present groundwater level cannot contribute to the crops. A subsurface collector at its exit in drainage unit 106 was controlled to raise the watertable. The study area was divided into 10 zones. Each zone was separately assessed to analyze the groundwater impact in response to the controlled technique adopted for mitigating drought in different strategies of the canal operation. The interaction of groundwater level with irrigation depth, crop yield, water use efficiency and water saving were also studied. During the rotational period of the canal, irrigations applied in section II raised the water level by nearly 1 m. The upslope area of section III also needed a large irrigation depth. The groundwater level on the downslopes of the lateral drains in sections I and V was at the design depth of 1.1 m during the rotational strategy, while it decreased only slightly on the upslopes of the lateral drains for the same positions. Because of effective control by the collector, the watertable on the downslopes of the laterals in sections II and III was affected less while in the respective upslope area of section III it dropped more than 2 m. The water levels in section IV (both in the upslope and downslope areas along the laterals) remained very close to the design level. A significant contribution of seepage in the upslope of the collector drain considerably reduced the irrigation depths. During the canal closure period, the watertables in the study area dropped to the limit from 2.3 to 3.25 m. After the reopening of the canal, the watertables in sections II, III and IV were raised from 2.55 to 0.70 m. During this period the water levels near the canal reached the design level. The maximum yield of 6.5 tons ha-1 on the downslopes of the lateral drains in section II was obtained, resulting in maximum water use efficiency of 0.93 kg m-3. However, the minimum yield of 3.5 tons ha-1 on the upslopes of the lateral drains in section I was obtained, resulting in the lowest water use efficiency of 0.35 kg m-3 near the deep surface drain (5 m). The impact of controlled subsurface drainage in zones 2, 3 and 7 resulted in the best maintenance of optimum groundwater level and moisture content. Therefore large amounts of extra irrigation water applied (ranging from 23 to 129% of that actually required) in different zones of the controlled area can be saved for drought conditions.

Census block groups are aggregated to provide an alternative to more commonly used geographic delimitations of communities, specifically census places. With the block group aggregation approach, census data can be applied to almost 1.5 million more people in the NWFP region than would be represented by using census places. The delimitation of community boundaries is intended to facilitate future research on understanding and characterizing conditions, structures, and change. Factors to consider in conducting social science research at the small scale are discussed. Ways in which communities have been defined for social assessments and monitoring are identified. The influence of data availability on determining the unit of analysis and research focus at the small scale is discussed.","Community; Ecosystem management; Northwest Forest Plan; Social assessment; Socioeconomic monitoring","census; ecosystem management; forest management; socioeconomic survey; United States","Donoghue, E.M.; Forestry Sciences Laboratory, P.O.

In particular, we emphasize the status of primary schooling in the community as a factor of policy significance. Both provinces appear to be on the leading edge of the demographic transition in Pakistan if measured on the basis of recent rapid increases in contraceptive practice: among provinces in Pakistan, Punjab has the highest contraceptive prevalence levels, and NWFP experienced the most rapid rise in contraceptive use in the early 1990s. Our goal was to visit a range of rural villages or communities that reflect diverse socioeconomic and schooling conditions to explore the possible links between the schooling environment at the community level and family-building patterns. Section II discusses the development of hypotheses about the possible links between primary school access and quality and family-building behavior in the Pakistani context.

We conducted a basin-wide geographic information system analysis of the nonmotorized accessibility of Amazonian NTFP extraction and estimated the proportion of the Amazon drainage basin within Brazil (3.74 million km2) that can be accessed on foot from the nearest navigable river or functional road. We use a long-term series of standardized line-transect vertebrate censuses conducted throughout the region to illustrate the effects of physical accessibility on wildlife densities in terms of hunting pressure as a function of distance from the nearest point of access. Population abundance in large-bodied, prime-target species preferred by game hunters tended to increase at greater distances from the access matrix, whereas small-bodied species ignored by hunters usually showed the reverse trend. In addition, we estimated the proportion of presumably inviolate core areas within nature, extractive, and indigenous reserves of Brazilian Amazonia that are prohibitively remote and unlikely to be overhunted; for instance, only 1.16% of the basin-wide area is strictly protected on paper and is reasonably safe from extractive activities targeted to game vertebrates and other valuable NTFPs. Finally, we discuss the concept of truly undisturbed wildlands in the last major tropical forest regions by distinguishing potentially overharvested areas from those that remain largely or entirely pristine and that maintain viable populations of a full complement of harvest-sensitive species.",,"accessibility; ecological impact; harvesting; hunting; nontimber forest product; tropical forest; vertebrate; Brazil; Vertebrata","Peres, C.A.; Ctr. for Ecol., Evol./Conservation, , Norwich NR4 7TJ, United Kingdom; email: c.peres@uea.ac.uk",,,08888892,,CBIOE,,"English","Conserv.

With the overthrow of Nawaz Sharif in a bloodless coup in October 1999, the military marched out of the barracks after more than a decade. The new military ruler, Pervez Musharraf started consolidating power and giving supremacy to the armed forces in shaping Pakistan's destiny through an engineered referendum; appeasement of jihadi and religious parties; marginalisation of mainstream political parties and a series of controversial amendments. These were not new practices in Pakistan's troubled politics. But what is new in the October 2002 general elections, is that the religious parties and two Provincial Assemblies—those of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Baluchistan—made inroads into the National Assembly in an impressive fashion. A. conglomeration of six parties, the Muttahida Majilis‐e‐Amal (MMA) emergéd as a new political force and a political alternative to the PPP and PML‐Nawaz (PML‐N).

Assessing the agronomic and conservation potential of NTFP requires the integration of ecological information on optimal conditions for growth and reproduction with socioeconomic data on local farming economies and labor calendars. The terrestrial bromeliad, Aechmea magdalenae, is a typical NTFP harvested for its fiber in the rainforests of southern Mexico and Guatemala. In the buffer zone of Mexico's Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve, cultivation trials using ramets transplanted from wild populations were initiated as a strategy to conserve buffer zone forests. We compared four measures of growth and survival of rosettes under the different light conditions of primary versus secondary forests; wild versus cultivated populations; over different seasons; and propagated by different methods. We also contrasted initial costs, economic returns and labor demands for A. magdalenae cultivation with the other major land-uses in the region. Compared to cattle production, the major cause of deforestation in the region, A. magdalenae cultivation offers high economic returns and low labor and initial costs. Seasonal differences in rates of leaf and ramet production indicated that the optimal timing for harvest of these parts does not interfere with local farmers subsistence agricultural duties. Secondary forest rosettes grew faster than primary forest rosettes due to higher light conditions, and secondary forests were also more accessible to local farmers for cultivation. Cultivation implied ecological costs in terms of ramet severance and adaptation, but the less-dense growing conditions of cultivated plants resulted in higher growth rates by the end of the second year. A. magdalenae cultivation trials in Los Tuxtlas have illustrated that farmers will protect their forests from deforestation and forest fires when they hold economic value. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

NTFP sale ranked as the most important source of cash income for 30% of women interviewed, and either second- or third-most important for the remainder. The research examined harvesting impact on populations of T. lineata, an understory tree species characteristic of cloud forest, which this was assessed in the four most-frequented collecting sites. Our results suggested that current harvesting approaches appear to be sustainable, although 95% of the women interviewed reported a decline in resource availability within the last 15 years, apparently resulting from illegal cutting.

Of central interest are reforestation, the nursery sector and non-timber forest products (NTFP), especially the mushroom industry (Tricholoma matsutake and Cordyceps sinensis), which currently generates the largest share of local cash income. The ban offers opportunities to advance NTFP harvesting, processing and marketing, as well as the development of other sustainable resources, which have not received enough attention from development planners in the past. NFPP also provides the opportunity to improve local environmental conditions through forest restoration and revegetation of degraded slopes. Furthermore, former and present forestry practices fail to integrate local people in the state-run forestry sector, although this sector lends itself to community participation.

Unlike in many forests of India, the Forest Department controlled the collection of NTFPs in Chel and earned revenues by virtue of their land rights. The people employed in NTFP collection were those who had been settled in forest villages to supply labour and allowed to farm areas allocated to them and permitted to keep cattle. Therefore, their cash income did not depend on selling NTFPs though they extracted them for their own use. The intensity of the collection of NTFPs either increased (fuelwood and fodder) or decreased after an initial increase (rattan, bamboo and thatch) over time due to variation in the resource stock, demand of the end user and cultural changes. The extraction of some NTFPs ceased on account of diminishing demand and rising production costs (leaves and baskets). Conversely, some NTFPs (broom heads and stone boulders) entered the commercial extraction domain on escalating demand. There is an integral but complex relationship between the extraction intensity and the resource base of NTFPs that may vary with the product as well as with other social, economic and policy factors. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eastern himalaya; Extraction intensity; Non-timber forest products; Resource base; Sustainability","forest management; harvesting; historical record; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; temporal analysis; Darjeeling; Darjeeling Himalaya; Himalayas; India; West Bengal; Animalia; Bos taurus; Calamus rotang","Shankar, U.; Department of Botany, , Shillong, 793 022, India; email: arshuma@yahoo.com",,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

Few studies have investigated the utilitarian and cultural roles of forests and trees in an integrated manner. Most studies have been focused on indigenous communities with little attention given to the role of biodiversity in local communities living under non-traditional conditions. Furthermore most research has focussed on the extraction of resources in tropical rain forests and only recently have attempts been made to determine the contribution of temperate-zone vegetation types. The aim of this paper was to highlight the significance of plant diversity in the livelihoods of rural communities within the Valley Bushveld in South Africa. It documents the various uses of NTFP's, the species used, the amounts harvested and their value of nine different use categories. In total 103 plant species were used, but only 17 were recorded by over 10% of the households on a regular basis. The mean gross direct use value for the utilisation of wild plant resources amounts to $1591 per annum per household. The use of NTFP's is not purely utilitarian. Approximately one-third of the species and just over half of the total use value were for cultural purposes. This illustrates that plant diversity is important in serving the cultural needs of non-traditional local communities. Programmes for biodiversity conservation should heed its role in traditional cultures. © 2003 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Cultural diversity; Eastern Capenergy; Plant diversity; South Africa; Valley Bushveld","biodiversity; culture; rural area; species diversity; tree; Eastern Cape; South Africa","Wiersum, K.F.; Wageningen University, , AH Wageningen, 6700, South Africa; email: freerk.Wiersum@BHHK.BOSB.WAU.NL",,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

The tree is source of an important gum called kullu gum, gum karaya or katira. Katira—a nationalized forest product in Madhya Pradesh—is commercially and industrially very important. The Saheriyas—a forest dependent tribal community of Sheopur—extract katira from naturally growing kullu trees in the neighbouring forests, using their traditional gum tapping technique. However, this method of gum tapping is destructive and wasteful. Also, the gum thus collected contains impurities like wood-chips and dust and fetches a very low market price. Recognising the need to enhance the capacities of the gum tappers in the District to harvest this precious NTFP resource sustainably, the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM) conducted action research and organised a series of village-level skill enhancement programs in Sheopur for the gum-tappers as well as for the Forest Department staff. This paper discusses the improved method of gum tapping that has been disseminated among the tribal community in Sheopur. Adoption of this technique will help to conserve the locally available Kullu resource and provide long term livelihood support for the community. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Gum karaya; India; Katira; NTFP; Saheriya; Sustainable harvest","harvesting; indigenous population; methodology; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; training; India; Sterculia; Sterculia urens","Bhattacharya, P.; Indian Institute of Forest Management, Nehru Nagar, Bhopal, MP, 462003, India; email: prodyut@iifm.org",,,14728028,,,,"English","For.

We provide business and legal issues training, consultation on small business and community-based enterprise development, and support for sustainability and monitoring programs. One of the basic principles of the project has been a participatory approach to project development and implementation. It is the hope of project participants that the successful development of NTFP and other opportunities will decrease the pressure to move forward with potentially damaging resource exploitation activities. Although community economic development is the primary goal, the revival and sharing of indigenous knowledge about NTFPs has been identified by participants as a key issue, and is a focus of educational materials being developed through the project.","Boreal forests; Community economic development; IUCN - The World Conservation Union; Kamchatka; Native communities; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Sakhalin; Sustainable use of natural resources; The Russian Far East; Traditional knowledge","Ecosystems; Soil conservation; Sustainable development; Wood products; Non-timber forest products; Forestry; community resource management; forest management; indigenous population; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; traditional knowledge; Canada; Far East; Russian Federation","Shmatkov, N.; IUCN - World Conserv.

The paper examines the trends in inequality from the most recent micro datasets of Pakistan Integrated Household Surveys (PIHS), 1998-99 and 2001-02. The results suggest that inequality has worsened in Pakistan between 1998-99 and 2001-02. While inequality declined in urban areas, inequality increased in rural areas over the period. Although urban inequality declined, the poorest 40 percent income groups in urban areas lost their income share, implying that decline was at the expense of the poor. While inequality declined in Punjab, NWFP, and Balochistan across urban areas, inequality increased significantly in urban Sindh. On the other hand, inequality declined in rural areas in Sindh, NWFP, and Balochistan but increased in rural Punjab over the period. The result suggests that decline in economic growth seems to have resulted in losses of income amongst the poorest groups and thus increased income inequality in Pakistan during the period. While a number of studies have already shown a rising trends in absolute poverty, inequality seems to have worsened also throughout the 1990s. The results suggest that income inequality is higher in 2001-02 than in the previous years of the 1990s. A strand of research shows that high inequality entails a lower subsequent rate of growth in average income and hence a lower rate of progress in reducing absolute poverty. Thus, if government aims to reduce absolute poverty via its growth-accelerating strategy, it should focus fundamentally on reducing high-income inequalities through its redistributive policies of taxes and transfers.",,"income distribution; poverty; regional economy; rural-urban comparison; Asia; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Pakistan; South Asia; World","Anwar, T.; Research Department, , Karachi, Pakistan",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

The Tagbanua, an indigenous people, inhabited one village; migrants from the Visayas Region of the Philippines populated the other. The third village is located on the Island of Leyte, in the Visayas Region, populated by native Visayan settlers. There was no significant difference in the number of NWFPs utilized by the indigenous people and the migrants. However, there was a wide disparity in income between the two groups, with migrants earning more, partly due to the marketing of commercial NWFPs. This gap could be decreased by fairer trading practices that are dependent in part on better educational opportunities, land rights, legal assistance and access to markets for the Tagbanua. Specific socioeconomic characteristics, such as the presence of a hunter within the household and size of the family were found to have a positive correlation with the use of NWFPs in some study villages. Income and the food expenditure of the household were inversely related with the use of NWFPs in the native Visayan village.","Indigenous people; Market; Migrants; Non-wood forest products (NWFPs); Philippines; Subsistence","Commerce; Education; Marketing; Non-wood forest products; Forestry; ethnicity; indigenous population; migrant worker; nontimber forest product; trade; Commerce; Education; Forestry; Marketing; Philippines","Lacuna-Richman, C.; Faculty of Forestry, P.O.

Settings: Study was conducted in the department of Paediatric and Neonatology, Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar. Design: A study conducted over a period of two years from July 1997 to June 1999. Methods: One hundred and fifty children up to fifteen years of age with clinical suspicion of congenital heart disease were subjected to chest X-Ray and Electrocardiography while the final diagnosis was confirmed by Echocardiography. Results: Out of 150 cases, 100 were males (66.66%) and 50 females (33.33%). Sixty eight percent of children with congenital heart disease presented at age less than 5 years and only 2% at age above 10 years. Two-third of the total children had acyanotic cardiac lesions. Ventricular septal defect followed by aortic stenosis, mild pulmonary stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus and atrioventricular septal defect were the commonest acyanotic congenital heart lesions. Tetralogy of Fallot followed by transposition of great arteries and tricuspid atresias were the commonest cyanotic congenital heart lesions. Conclusion: Majority of patient with congenital heart disease detected in a tertiary care center have non-cyanotic CHD. TOF is the commonest cyanotic lesion and VSD non-cyanotic lesion. In order to avoid complications, early detection of congenital heart disease is of utmost importance for proper management. This can be achieved by examining newborns in maternity units, postnatal clinics, special care baby units, immunization centers, primary health care units and at school entry. 2D echo with Doppler examination forms the gold standard for diagnosis.","Acyanotic congenital heart lesions; Congenital heart disease; Cyanotic congenital heart lesions; Electrocardiography and Echocardiography; Tetralogy of Fallot; Ventricular septal defect","adolescent; aorta stenosis; article; child; child care; childhood disease; congenital heart disease; Doppler echocardiography; early diagnosis; echocardiography; electrocardiogram; Fallot tetralogy; female; great vessels transposition; health survey; heart atrium septum defect; heart ventricle septum defect; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; patent ductus arteriosus; pulmonary valve stenosis; sex ratio; thorax radiography; tricuspid valve atresia","Rahim, F.H.

With a view to providing evidence for the hypothesised link between exploitation and conservation/development in the non-timber forest product (NTFP) debate, it evaluates the feasibility of using the commercial exploitation of buho (Schizostachyum lumampao) as a strategy for conserving the rain forest. An analytical framework is used to assess whether the principal conditions of sustainable extraction - ecological sustainability, economic feasibility and political and social acceptability - are being fulfilled. The authors conclude that, despite the lack of possibilities for adding value, the lack of organisation and the illegality of extraction, buho gathering in the study village is economically feasible as an ancillary activity. Moreover, the regenerative capacity of the plant is such that buho extraction itself does not cause the depletion of the resource, as long as immature poles are not cut. The authors argue, however, that the sustainability of buho extraction - as of any other non-timber forest product - cannot be judged on the basis of the features of the extractive economy alone. The extraction of buho does not affect agricultural expansion or migration to the forest frontier, which are the main causes of deforestation and depletion of buho resources in the study area. Only in relatively stable situations, where forest resources are not under pressure, may buho extraction offer opportunities to improve peoples' livelihoods and sustain forest conservation. In such instances, the authors recommend the organisation of gatherers into cooperatives and the demarcation of protected extraction areas.","Bamboo; Buho (Schizostachyum lumampao) extraction; Deforestation; Forest conservation; Forest use; Livelihoods; Non-timber forest products; Sustainability; The Philippines","Schizostachyum","Ros-Tonen, M.A.F.; Amsterdam Res.

Data from the 1995 inventory of western Oregon, conducted by Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA), were analyzed to determine if forest condition and environmental variables provide useful correlations with the abundance and cover of NTFP plant species. An assessment of representative NTFP plant species of the Pacific Northwest provided a list of 76 species for the analysis. Of 55 NTFP species found in the database, 14 occurred with plot frequency high enough for statistical analysis. Frequency was significantly correlated with several environmental and forest condition variables.

Do suitable methods or databases exist to assess commercial understory species quantity and quality? Can we determine how timber management, specifically overstory manipulations, impacts commercial understory species quantity and quality? To address the first question, we conducted a synthesis of current inventory methods and databases for understory species and the adequacy of these methods and databases to provide appropriate information about commercial quantity and quality. We found that sampling methods exist or are being developed that can be applied to NTFP species for inventory and monitoring purposes. However, information and methodology regarding commercial quality and quantity are lacking. Current forest resource surveys frequently do not provide appropriate spatial and temporal resolution for local information needs and commercial quantity and quality data are lacking. To address the second question, we conducted two studies in western Oregon. Our results showed that understory development and relationships with overstory variables have deterministic components that can help guide compatible management; but, to best determine how silvicultural treatments might affect commercial understory species supply, it is important to take into account product attributes, species and site specific responses.","Forest structure; Inventory databases; Inventory methods; Nontimber forest products; Overstory; Understory","commercial species; forest inventory; forest management; nontimber forest product; United States","Kerns, B.K.; PNW Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, Corvallis, OR 97331, United States",,,08874840,,,,"English","USDA For.

Box 3890, Portland, OR 97208, United States","When the Northwest Forest Plan for the Recovery of the Northern Spotted Owl (NWFP) and associated species was established in 1994, it shifted federal land management emphasis toward noncommodity outputs. Since then, forest practices on state land in Oregon and Washington were also modified to emphasize resources other than timber. At the same time, commercial forest owners have moved to shorter rotations and most of the region's sawmills have been retooled to process smaller (< 24 inch, 61 cm) logs. Management plans for public land allow a variety of management activities, some of which may remove trees that are 50 to 120 years old and 20 or more inches (51 cm) in diameter at breast height (dbh). It is likely that these trees are larger and older than those removed from private land but because of their relatively young age, they might not necessarily yield higher value wood products. Some of the logs cut from these trees might also be too large to process in the region's sawmills making them less attractive to potential buyers. We used empirical wood product recovery data to conduct an analysis to contrast the economic value of 20 to 30 inch (51 to 76 cm) dbh trees in the 50 to 80 year and 100 to 150 year age classes. The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate the importance of age in controlling economic value in trees of the same size. The older trees had dollar values of as much as 55% higher per board foot than the younger trees. This analysis suggests that some of proposed treatments on public land will result in trees that could be difficult to market to the region's wood processors and, therefore, might not provide the economic returns anticipated under the Northwest Forest Plan or by state forestry plans in Oregon and Washington.","Lumber; Silviculture; Western Oregon and Washington; Wood products; Wood quality","economic analysis; forest management; silviculture; timber; wood quality; United States; Strigiformes; Strix occidentalis caurina","Barbour, R.J.; U.S. Department of Agriculture, P.O.

Interviews and observations with harvesters, storeowners, and furniture-makers provided information about current and potential markets for goods made from the palm. To understand the demographic variables that are critical for population stability, data from five plots in each of three different forest types (mature, secondary, and dissected) were collected. Matrix models were used to develop harvesting simulations through which biological constraints on sustainable harvesting were explored. These simulations suggest that sparing individuals 5-15 m tall when pastures are cleared and adding this palm to current agroforestry polycultures can improve the likelihood of sustainable harvesting for this species. Results showed that harvesting Iriartea could fit within current land use. Some forest colonists clear pastures to graze cattle, while others devote land to agriculture, including polycultures of annuals and perennials. In either case, palms can be left standing when forests are cleared. Swidden agriculture (slash and burn or slash and mulch) depends on a fallow period during which secondary forest may begin to regenerate. These secondary forests are ideal locations for extraction of forest products that fit within the cycle of fallow regeneration in areas near human settlements. Sparing Iriartea individuals 5-15 m tall could benefit agriculture, encourage the sustainability of future harvests, and help ensure the future of this palm as a part of the Amazonian landscape. Interviews with staff of governmental and non-governmental conservation organizations investigated the policy context for certification as a mechanism for conservation. Establishing guidelines for harvesting requires input from all stakeholders in the decision, not simply an ecological analysis. Such guidelines for certifying good management practices, if they are developed, should include provisions for monitoring unanticipated consequences of harvesting or changes in future environmental conditions. Transportation issues and stem drying processes need to be addressed if efforts to expand markets are to succeed. More generally, guidelines for management of forest resources can be improved by combining ecological and social research perspectives; the potential for carrying out such guidelines can be improved by incorporating the knowledge of local forest dwellers and NGOs. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

A market survey of NTFPs occurring in the Capim River basin in eastern Amazonia, Brazil demonstrated that the reality for many smallholder communities in frontier and remote regions includes chronic transportation difficulties, high variability in fruit production, perishable products and lack of market expertise. In some communities, declining abundance of NTFPs due to logging and fire has resulted in a lack of forest products to even meet subsistence needs. In areas close to cities where transportation is assured and where forest clearing has eroded the natural occurrence of some valuable native NTFPs, smallholders who manage and successfully market native fruit and medicinal species are overcoming these obstacles. In frontier regions undergoing rapid transformation, however, decline in locally used and regionally marketed NTFPs currently pose detrimental consequences for communities. Findings suggest that an overemphasis on NTFP marketing has diverted attention from local livelihood, resource access and subsistence issues.","Amazonian fruits; Amazonian medicinals; Marketing forest products; Non-timber forest products; Sustainable development; Tropical forest management","market development; nontimber forest product; sustainable development; tropical forest; Brazil","Shanley, P.; Ctr. for Intl.

A crucial step in the right direction would be to increase the payoffs to forest protection by (amongst other things) enhancing the returns from non-timber forest produce (NTFP) and regularizing as well as enhancing felling returns. At the same time, the state should look at the factors that are connected to illegal timber felling or the over-extraction of NTFP and try to eliminate those which encourage such behaviour as well as enhance those which discourage such behaviour. Steps have to be taken to improve the operation of the FPC - in particular, ensure frequent meetings for the resolution of conflicts as well as the dissemination of knowledge. While doing this, one has to be conscious of the political factor and take this into account as a motivating factor in whatever strategy each FPC member or the executive committee adopts.

But the ability to conserve biodiversity through NTFP management, particularly in extractive reserves in Amazonia, has remained untested. We found that intensive management of Euterpe oleracea (Palmae) fruit, one of the most important extractive products in the Amazon, has substantial impacts on biodiversity, whereas moderate management does not. We mimicked traditional levels of fruit harvest in a replicated experiment over one fruiting season. High-intensity harvest (75% of fruits removed) reduced avian frugivore species diversity by 22%. Low-intensity harvest (40% of fruits removed), however, had no effect on diversity. On a larger scale, we found that forests with enriched densities of E. oleracea supported more fruit-eating birds but fewer non fruit-eating birds than non-enriched forests. Taken together, these results suggest that intensive NTFP management to meet market demands may trigger substantial ecological impacts, at least at the level of our study. E. oleracea harvest should be limited where conservation of biodiversity is a goal.","Amazonia; Biodiversity; Euterpe oleracea; Extractive reserves; Frugivores; Fruit harvest; Non-timber forest products","biodiversity; conservation management; ecological impact; harvesting; nontimber forest product; tropical forest; South America; Arecaceae; Aves; Euterpe oleracea; Galliformes","Moegenburg, S.M.; Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, National Zoological Park, Washington, DC 20008, United States; email: moegenburgs@nzp.si.edu",,,1461023X,,ECLEF,,"English","Ecol.

Methods: Interviews were conducted in a total of 54 834 households: Balochistan, 20 486; NWFP, 26 175; and FATA, 8173. Trained interviewers administered questionnaires after obtaining verbal informed consent from the respondents. Verbal autopsy interviews were conducted for infant deaths reported for the previous year. Findings: The infant mortality rate based on combined data from the different sites was 99.7 per 1000 live births (range 129.0-70.1). The contribution of neonatal deaths to all infant deaths was much higher for NWFP (67.2%), where the overall rate was lowest, than for Balochistan (50.8%) and FATA (56.8%). Around 70% of all neonatal deaths occurred in the early neonatal period. The three main clinical causes of infant deaths were diarrhoea syndrome (21.6%), tetanus (11.7%) and acute respiratory infections (11.6%). In the neonatal period, however, tetanus (18.3%), small size for gestational age or low birth weight (15.3%), and birth injury (12.0%) accounted for nearly half (45.6%) of all deaths, while the contributions of diarrhoea syndrome (5.1%) and acute respiratory infections (6.0%) were less significant (11.1%) Tetanus was the cause of death for 21.7% and 17.1% of all infant deaths in FATA and NWFP respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that there should be a shift in child survival programmes to give greater emphasis to maternal and neonatal health, in particular to maternal tetanus immunization, safe delivery and cord care.","Cause of death; Infant mortality; Infant, Newborn; Pakistan; Rural population; Sampling studies","child health; infant mortality; rural population; survival; article; birth injury; cause of death; congenital malformation; diarrhea; human; infant; infant mortality; infection rate; low birth weight; major clinical study; mortality; newborn; newborn mortality; newborn sepsis; Pakistan; prematurity; respiratory tract infection; rural area; sampling; survival rate; tetanus; Cause of Death; Family Characteristics; Humans; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Interviews; Pakistan; Questionnaires; Rural Population; Survival Analysis; Pakistan","Fikree, F.F.; Population Council, 1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York, NY 10017, United States; email: ffikree@popcouncil.org",,,00429686,,BWHOA,"12075362","English","Bull.

Community forestry is assigned a major role in supplying these substitutes, and natural regeneration and rehabilitation of degraded forests are thought to be means to establish forests with a high compatibility with villagers' demand. This study investigates the structure and floristic composition of six community forests established through natural regeneration of degraded sal (Shorea robusta) forests and of former riverine forest areas which have been cleared and overgrazed. The inventories are compared to an in-depth survey of the extraction of forest products from Royal Chitwan National Park (RCNP) for 12 consecutive months by nine households. The results show that natural regeneration creates a multi-layered forest structure and that early succession stages of mixed forests, which floristically resemble former primary forests, emerged in only a few years when protected from grazing. The presence of timber and fuelwood species in the community forest matched to some extent the species traditionally extracted by people from the Park.

Only 16.3% of the farmers were regularly vaccinating their flocks. The majority of the farmers initiated immunization only at the time of disease onset (29.7%) followed by those (28.5%) who did not vaccinate. A high proportion (53.3%) provided no housing, 29.8% provide night shelters and 17% had no housing. Average flock size was 22.0 birds, comprising 8.86 chicks, 2.03 pullets and 11.1 layers. The local Desi chicken dominated the flocks (10.2 birds) followed by Fayumi (6.76), Rhode Island Red (4.20) with White Leghorn least popular (0.83 ). Average mortality in a flock was 23.6%. Mortality was higher in layers (28.1%) than in pullets (18.7%) and chicks (24.2%). Significantly higher losses were found in White Leghorn (35.6%) than in Desi chicken (17.5%). Similarly, higher mortality was found in chicken without housing facilities (26.7%) than in those with access to houses (21.6%). Regular vaccination was associated with higher productivity than vaccination at the onset of disease or no vaccination. Average annual egg production was 76.4 for Desi, 109 for Fayumi, 169 for Rhode Island and 153 for White Leghorn. Mean hatchability was 61.2% with an annual frequency of 4.6 settings and 15.1 eggs set per broody hen. Farmer preference for the ""local"" Desi chicken reflected their greater capacity to survive and adapt to scavenging management systems. Fayumi and Rhode Island chickens appear to merit further studies as breeds that could improve the productivity of scavenging systems, as they had higher egg production and only slightly higher mortality than Desi chicken.","Breed; Chicken; Eggs; Housing; Mortality; Rural; Scavenging; Vaccination; Women","Aves; Gallus gallus","Farooq, M.; Poultry Science Department, , Peshawar, Pakistan; email: geanes@psh.paknet.com.pk",,,01213784,,,,"English","Livest.

They provide employment to various sectors of society, draw on local expertise and culture, and increase the outputs of forests. In recent years, NTFP have received accrued interest by the general public, governments and the private sectors of Canada. However, for the NTFP industry to enter mainstream Canadian industrial culture it is now critical to attempt the integration of the timber industry with the NTFP industry to benefit both sectors. NTFP can be harvested from four types of environment: wild stocks from timber-productive forests, wild stocks from non-timber-productive forests or lands, managed stocks from intensively managed forests, and domesticated stocks from agricultural systems. A large body of evidence suggests that NTFP management and harvest can serve the forest industry in many ways. There are four possible types of interaction between the NTFP and timber industries: independent resource use, competition for resources, complementary resource use and symbiotic resource use. Integration of both industries in a sustainable manner will need to be supported with research that address economic, social, policy and ecological questions.","Biodiversity; Community forestry; NTFP; Sustainability","Employment; Harvesting; Sustainable development; Timber; Nontimber forest products (NTFP); Forestry; community resource management; forest management; nontimber forest product; silviculture; sustainable forestry; Forestry; Forests; Harvesting; Canada","Duchesne, L.C.; Natural Resources Canada, 1219 Queen St East, Sault Ste.

But NTFP ought to be viewed from the perspective of ecological processes, cultural heritage, livelihood of local people, economic values and incentives for forest management. This broader role for NTFP cannot be realised by simply domesticating a few species. Integration of NTFP in forest management is necessary in order to achieve sustainable forestry. Because forestry technologies are developed with timber values uppermost, it is vital to develop forest management technologies that take into account both timber and non-timber values. Global examples show that traditional knowledge could play a vital role while developing silvicultural regimes, and in situ experimentation will strengthen the regimes.

Several case studies document the importance of the forest in both North and South America. While studies differ in their conclusions regarding the sustainability of NTFP extraction, most researchers agree that sustainable harvesting is rare. The article argues for additional considerations that transcend the biological and economic concerns. While forests provide the basis of material culture for peoples that inhabit them, they are also linked intrinsically to the religion, mythology, and psyche of native peoples.

The study was conducted to determine the prevalence and gravity of ocular complications in institutionalized leprosy patients in NWFP. It is important to provide necessary information to leprosy health workers and general physicians in order to sensitize them to early detection and treatment or referral to appropriate centre. METHODS: A prospective study of ocular complications of leprosy patients was conducted at the leprosy centre of Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar and the Leprosy Hospital Balakot, district Mansehra. The study included a record of the name, age, sex, type, duration of disease and completion of multi-drug therapy (MDT). Classification of the patients was done according to Ridley and Jopling 5-group system. Visual acuity was tested by Snellen chart and those patients having a vision of less than 3/60 were labelled as blind. Ocular adnexa were examined by naked eye and lacrimal sac regurgitation test was done. Slit lamp biomicroscopy was done for anterior segment examination and direct ophthalmoscope was used for fundoscopy. RESULTS: The authors studied 143 patients in the above mentioned leprosy centres. Out of these, 59 had lepromatous leprosy, 39 borderline tuberculoid leprosy, 9 tuberculoid leprosy, 33 borderline lepromatous leprosy, and 33 borderline leprosy. The majority of patients came from the northern districts of NWFP, including Malakand division and district Mansehra. The male to female ratio was 4:1. The age of the patients ranged from 14 to 80 years and the duration of the disease ranged from 1 year to 48 years. Ocular complications were found in 73% of the patients. These complications included loss of eyebrows in 57 patients, loss of eyelashes in 37, corneal changes (including opacity, ulceration, and/or anaesthesia) in 44, iridocyclitis in 31, lagophthalmos in 36, ectropion in 13, and chronic dacryocystitis in 3. Of the total of 15 (11%) patients who went blind from ocular complications, 16 eyes did so due to corneal opacities, 6 eyes due to cataract, 5 eyes due to chronic anterior uveitis and one eye due to corneal ulcer, panophthalmitis and phthisis bulbi each. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of leprosy patients (73%) have ocular complications. The frequency of ocular complications increases with the increasing age and duration of disease of the patients.",,"adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; eye disease; female; human; leprosy; male; middle aged; Pakistan; prospective study; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; Leprosy; Male; Middle Aged; Pakistan; Prospective Studies","Khan, T.",,,10259589,,,"12688099","English","J Ayub Med Coll Abbottabad",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037839343

It is usually present in agroforestry systems in the region, particularly in homegardens and cocoa and coffee agroforests. It plays an important role in household consumption and the surplus is sold on the rural and urban market. A lack of attention by research and extension services means that there is neither scientific knowledge nor official recommendations for its management in agroforestry systems. The attempt to introduce it into forest fallows in Côte d'Ivoire is a good example of industrial involvement in the development of agroforestry and the expansion of tree production in West Africa.

Socioeconomic aspects of the gaharu trade were investigated via interviews with collectors and local and international traders. In addition, the extent of local and international trade was evaluated by reference to official government statistics. Evidence that gaharu resources are declining obtained from the personal experience of gaharu collectors, and official statistics relating to the declining number of gaharu export companies in operation. Traders also reported that the main source of gaharu has recently switched from Sumatra and Kalimantan to sources in eastern Indonesia (Maluku and Irian Jaya), a finding supported by official statistics. Disparities recorded between official figures for the price and volume of gaharu in local and international trade, supported by comments made by export traders, indicate that a high proportion of the more valuable, high-grade gaharu is traded illegally by personal transaction. Interviews with gaharu collectors indicated that traditional approaches to harvesting are declining, as more nonlocal people become involved in collection, leading to more intensive harvesting practices. Together, these findings suggest that the current Indonesian trade in gaharu is not sustainable.","CITES; Gaharu; Harvesting; NTFP; Sustainability","Aquilaria; Aquilaria; Thymelaeaceae","Soehartono, T.; DG Forest Protect./Nature Conserv., Manggala Wanabakti Block VII, Gatot Subroto, Jakarta, Indonesia",,"New York Botanical Garden Press",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

Within a decade of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the arrival of 2.3 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, the annual burden of malaria among refugees had risen ten fold from 11,200 cases in 1981 to 118,000 cases in 1991, a burden greater than the one reported by the Pakistan Ministry of Health for the entire Pakistani population. Political developments in the 1990s led to over half the refugee population repatriating to Afghanistan, and the Afghan Refugee Health Programme (ARHP) was scaled down proportionately. Districts in which the ARHP recorded a reduced incidence of malaria began to show an increased incidence in the statistics of the Pakistan government health programme. This and other evidence pointed to a change in health seeking practices of the refugees who remained in Pakistan, with many turning from ARHP to Pakistani health services as aid declined. Comparison of the two sources of data produced no evidence for the spatial distribution of malaria in NWFP having changed during the 1990s. Nor was there any evidence for the presence of refugees having increased the malaria burden in the Pakistani population, as is sometimes alleged. This highlights the risk of misinterpreting health trends when parallel health services are operating. Over the decade incidence in the refugee camps decreased by 25% as a result of control activities, and by 1997 the burden among remaining refugees had fallen to 26,856 cases per annum. These trends indicate that the burden would continue to fall if political conditions in Afghanistan were to improve and more refugees returned to their homeland. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This aims to ensure improvement in the quality and safety of lives of women through adoption of health and non-health strategies. Antenatal care is a branch of preventive medicine dealing with prevention and early detection of pregnancy disorders. It is the key to modern obstetrics. METHODS: It was a descriptive type of study to find out the attitude of the women towards utilization of antenatal care facility at a newly commissioned hospital, Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar, Pakistan in the first year of its working. RESULTS: We recorded 980 patients. All of them were married. Monthly attendance showed increasing trend. In this study 72.44% of the women were of 25-35 year of age while 11.42% were teenager. Multiparity was recorded in 38.97% and 12.14% had more then nine pregnancies. Six hundred and fifty patients were living near the hospital. 2.24% patients visited more than six times and 63.26% had one visit only, with the rest visiting for 2-5 times. Thirty patients had medical disorders. Obstetrical diseases were detected in 194 patients. Pregnancy losses contributed to 146 women and 3 women had more then 6 losses. 254 women selected hospital delivery. Out of then 160 women were booked in the 3rd trimester. Caesarean section rate among those women was 16.4%. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion drawn was that the women living near the hospital used the facility. Antenatal care should be provided to the women at the doorstep of their house. There is a system of lady health workers that should be expanded to cover all areas. Basic health units must be fully equipped and staffed. Communication system should be improved.

Is sustainable harvesting of wild rattan an oxymoron? If not, under what biophysical, socio-economic and institutional conditions might harvesting be viable? This article documents an attempt to assess and monitor ecological effects associated with cane extraction in primary forests, based on five years of ongoing research by the author in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The study focused on Calamus zollingeri, a commercially important large-diameter rattan used in furniture manufacturing. The article focuses on only two among the many direct and indirect ecological effects examined in the study: • direct impacts to the plant and to plant parts and cane growth; • ecological impacts of using floater logs to transport cane to market. In addition, the article points out that possible adverse effects to other flora or fauna must be weighed against those of alternative economic activities (e.g. converting forests to annual or perennial cash crops). Finally, it examines the viability of managing wild rattan harvesting versus rattan cultivation.",,"forestry production; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainability; Arundinaria; Calamus rotang","Siebert, S.F.; School of Forestry, , Missoula, MT, United States",,,00416436,,,,"English","Unasylva",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035745407

Aonla fruit is a rich natural source of vitamin C and is an integral part of a number of Ayurvedic (Indian system of medicine) formulations. Aonla fruits start maturing after December but due to great demand by industries and intense competition among collectors, pre-mature harvesting starts in October. The entire fruit collection is over within a span of 2-3 weeks. Prevalent harvesting practices of Aonla fruits involve lopping and pollarding of branches and in some places even felling of the whole tree. The results reported in this paper pertain to some tropical dry deciduous forests of central India, which form an industrial catchment for the supply of raw Aonla fruits for pharmaceutical preparations to the prominent industries located in the area. The study compared the impact of extraction of fruits in Protected Areas (PAs) as well as in multiple use natural forests. While extraction of NTFPs from PAs is legally restricted, although villagers on the fringes sneak in and collect some quantity of fruits, no such restriction exists in multiple use forest areas. The unsustainable practices impact natural regeneration and damage fruiting trees. The results revealed that as against 16.00 ± 1.09 trees/ha of fruiting Aonla trees in PAs, the tree population in multiple use forests was observed to be very low (5.20 ± 3.09 trees/ha). A similar trend was observed in respect to natural regeneration also. As against a mean number of 20.00 ± 2.01 seedlings/ha in PAs, there were only 2.20 ± 1.50 seedlings/ha in multiple use areas. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We compare the net present value (NPV) of the current forest management approach (diameter limit harvests) with shelterwood harvests that promote light hardwood timber species. In this analysis, we also consider the potential of enrichment planting various precious timber (Diospyros quaesita - calamander), and non-timber forest product (NTFP) species (Caryota urens - fishtail palm; Elettaria cardamomum var. major -cardamom; Calamus zeylanicus - rattan) in conjunction with timber harvests. Two real (inflation adjusted) discount rates were used, 4 and 6%, respectively. Results show that when real discount rates are low (4%), and advance regeneration is present, NPV is highest for the one-cut shelterwood (US $9983 ha-l). At a high discount rate (6%), reflecting the current short-term concession system and unstable rights to harvest, and where no advance regeneration was present, the diameter limit system (US $7173 ha-l) was the optimum. On sites with advanced regeneration, the one-cut shelteiwood system is clearly preferable. For all but rattan, shelterwood treatments provide higher NPVs for NTFPs than diameter limit cuttings primarily because of the higher light regimes and more growing space made available early in the rotation. The value for tea cultivation (US $26,000 ha-1) far exceeds the value of managing these lands for timber alone, explaining the dramatic expansion in tea plantations on private lands. However, our results suggest that managing these lands for a combination of timber and enrichment plantings of NTFPs (US $23,000 ha-1) can be comparable to tea plantations. By managing for NTFPs and timber, forest managers have new opportunities to solve the old problems of high-grading and land-use conversion. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to evaluate the genetic diversity among the four lentil cultivars which were analysed with 20 random decamer primers. Out of 20, thirteen primers detected polymorphism in all varieties and six primers amplified the monomorphic DNA bands only a single primer could not amplify the genomic DNA of all the varieties. Similarity matrix was obtained after multivariant analysis using Nei and Li's coefficients. The coefficients of similarity matrix were used to construct dendrogram by the unweighted pair group method of arithmetic means (UPGMA). Three varieties viz., Masur-85, Masur-93 and NIAB-Lentil can be clustered in one group and the Precos in the second group. The similarity between the exotic variety Precos and the other three viz., NIAB-Lentil, Masur-93 and s. Masur-85 ranges from 45.15 to 64.25%. However, the similarity between the local adapted cultivars ranges from 77.88 to 86.36%. The analysis revealed that the inter-varietal genetic relationships of the varieties are related to their place of origin. It is therefore, proposed that the local varieties have narrow genetic base. The information collected can be utilised to map novel genes for different traits. Moreover, the information will provide a guideline to draw future breeding strategies and also help to enforce the intellectual breeders rights in the country.",,,"National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering (NIBGE), P.O.

Some special features of the flood plains are outlined and their implications for land-use are interpreted. A close interaction exists between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, implying that management needs to consider effects on both systems. By nature the flood plains are adapted to large perturbations, indicating that rough management interventions can be carded out, but only a limited proportion of each habitat is disturbed by nature at a time, suggesting that simultaneous profound large-scale interventions in certain habitats should be avoided. The high fertility of flood plain soils and periodical sedimentation hint that the risk of soil nutrient depletion is limited. The flood plain production potential is relatively high, although it varies much according to patterns of flooding and drainage, stressing the need to provide information on the geographic variation in these environmental factors. The culture and organisation of flood plain inhabitants is dynamic, and a patron system dominate in many economic activities. Few regulations control the access to and use of the flood plain natural resources, and no permanent tenure rights can be issued for flood plain land. This emphasises the need to promote adapted organisations and institutions, and to develop a land tenure system fostering incentives for management working on a long-term perspective. It was found that sustained timber production in the natural flood plain forests can have net present values (NPVs) up to US$ 250 per ha without accounting for growth enhancing effects. On the average the extraction value of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) was low, but certain habitats generated high economic benefits constituting a major part of the economy of many flood plain households. Domestication has a high potential and agroforestry is already widespread, but effects of flooding, bad drainage and risk of erosion by the river current are impediments to successful intensive land-use systems. Socio-economic distortions can be risked if land suited for agricultural subsistence production is gradually taken over by agriculturalists focusing on large-scale commercial production. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Conservation projects have therefore lacked information on customary rights to trees, while they have enforced systems of tree resource management that often conflicted with the indigenous system. This study focused on the indigenous tree tenure system of the Turkana pastoralists called ekwar (plural ngikwarin). The indigenous tree management system in 15.4 km2 of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands near Lodwar, Kenya was investigated. The study began in 1990 after impoundment of the Turkwel Gorge Dam. In 1990 and 1998, Turkana pastoralists were interviewed about the ekwar. In individual ngikwarin woody cover, wood volume and woody-plant density were measured, and wood extraction assessed in terms of stems and twigs removed by the pastoralists and the urban population of Lodwar. Intensity of charcoal burning was assessed in terms of the density of earthen kilns, and livestock impact in terms of browsing frequency on woody plants. Potential Acacia tortilis litter production was estimated and an ekwar quality index developed to describe woodland productivity conditions. Tree produce was shared with and leased to friends and relatives. Woody cover showed no significant changes, while woody-plant density and volume declined, over the 8-year period. The Turkana usually do not cut live trees, but use dead trees and dry tree-parts for making charcoal. Increased kiln density and increased extraction of tree-parts were considered to be indicative of increased pressure on the riverine woodlands. Livestock browsing did not seem to contribute to woodland degradation. However, decline in woody-plant density and volume might have contributed to the reduction of litter production of A. tortilis. Trends in woodlands in the floodplain might be associated with damming of the Turkwel River and local anthropogenic pressures. Also, the ekwar system of tree tenure seemed to be threatened by the official forestry policy that it be ignored. Incorporating the ekwar system into the forestry conservation policy may achieve sustainable use and improve conservation of the Turkwel River floodplain woodlands.","Ekwar silvo-pastoral system; Extraction of non-timber forest products; Floodplain; Kenya; Tree tenure; Turkana pastoralists; Turkwel River; Woodland conservation","Arid regions; Charcoal; Degradation; Woodland degradation; Forestry; charcoal; indigenous knowledge; land tenure; nontimber forest product; pastoralism; plant; article; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; forest; Kenya; tree; Kenya","Oba, G.; Agricultural University of Norway, PO Box 5001, N-1432, Ås, Norway; email: gufu.oba@noragric.nlh.no",,,03768929,,EVCNA,,"English","Environ.

This policy overview draws upon the authors' five years of ethnographic research on the politics of NTFPs and wild mushrooms in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States to describe and analyze barriers to NTFP harvester and buyer participation in NTFP policy fora. Three case examples of efforts by participants in NTFP industries to organize themselves politically so that they can have a voice in policy and management decisions are discussed.

First Americans used NTFPs in every fact of their lives. The new Americans, from early Euroameri-cans to the newest Asian Americans, have used nontimber forest products to provide subsistence resources and income support. Beginning in the 1970s, increased demand for medicinals, wild mushrooms, and floral products brought Mason County's NTFP industries back into the limelight. Unfortunately, the rise in demand for NTFPs has increased social conflict in Mason County. Indeed, disputes over harvesting practices and the tension between floral greens and wild mushroom business over across to NTFP leaves have made Mason County the floral point of recent efforts to expand government regulation of the NTFP industry in Washington. However, NTFPs may also provide opportunities for decreasing the political conflict over timber management in the region by creating financial incentives for landowners to maintain longer timber rotations. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Major cities of the basin are Peshawar (capital), Mardan, Charsadda and Nowshera. The E-W flowing Kabul river and its tributaries irrigate the basin and join the Indus at the eastern exit. Peshawar basin is surrounded by mountain ranges of Khyber in west and northwest, Attock-Cherat in south and Swat in the northeast. The basin is filled with Quaternary sediments ranging from Pleistocene to recent in age. These sediments overlie rocks of Paleozoic age. The Quaternary sediments of the Peshawar basin are physio-graphically classified as Peshawar piedmont-sediments, Peshawar lacustrine sediments and Peshawar flood plain/stream channel sediments. The sediments present in the foot-hills of the mountains in the western (Khyber Range) and southern (Attock-Cherat Range) part of the Peshawar basin are coarse deposits of sand and gravel. However, the sediments of the central part of the basin contain relatively large proportion of fine material and are characterized as the lacustrine sediments. On the basis of existing lithologies the aquifer of Peshawar basin has been classified as Peshawar piedmont aquifer and Peshawar lacustrine aquifer. The Peshawar piedmont aquifer has further been divided in to Khyber mountain range piedmont aquifer, Attock-Cherat range piedmont aquifer and lower Swat range Piedmont-aquifer. Fast growing urbanization and industrialization in and around the major cities is threatening the air as well as the surface and subsurface water systems of the Peshawar basin. In the cities, air is consistently polluted by vehicular emanations, industrial effluents and metals-born dust, which ultimately make their way to surface and underground water. This study is part of a large project concerning surface and subsurface water and soil pollution of major and trace elements and heavy metals. Preliminary hydrochemical and hydrogeolical study of the basin has been carried out by Bundsehuh (1992), Tariq et al. (1997). In addition Hamidullah et al. (1997a,b; 1998; 1999) investigated havey metals pollution in water, air, soil and sewerage system of the Peshawar city. This abstract represents data of quality of water and soil by considering their environmental impacts on the living organism of the whole Peshawar basin. The hydro-physical and chemical parameters of the water of Peshawar basin determined during the present study include pH, Temperature (T) electrical conductivity (Ec), total dissolved solid (TDS) calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), lead (Pb) cadmium (Cd), bicarbonate (HCO3), sulfate (SO4) and chloride (Cl). Subsurface and surface waters of all the aquifers and rivers respectively have been classified as normal alkaline fresh water and alkaline earth fresh water with higher contents of alkalies. This suggest that the cations and anions have played an important role in categorizing the waters of the Peshawar basin. On the basis of physical parameters (i.e. pH, T, Ec and TDS), the water of all the rivers and aquifers of Peshawar basin can be generally classified as 'fresh', however, 'Slightly saline' water is also present at various places. The subsurface waters of some areas have pH in acidic range and have high SO4 contents suggesting the contamination through coal and sulfide seems having metal sulfides. These areas of unsuitable drinking water have been delineated during this study. In order to establish the chemical contamination in the water of the various aquifers of Peshawar basin, the above mentioned parameters have been compared among various aquifers and also with the permissible limits of US-EPA and WHO. Various cations (e.g. Ca, Na, K, and Fe) anions (e.g. SO4, Cl, HCO3) and trace elements (e.g. Cu, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Co and Cd) in the drinking water of Peshawar are generally within the permissible limits set by US-EPA and WHO. However, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Pb, Cr, SO4, Cl, and HCO3 at some places exceed the permissible limit. This could generally be attributed to the compositional changes in the lithology of the area. This study also indicate that the soils of Peshawar basin have higher contents of few major elements such as MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O and trace elements such as Cu, Pb, Cr and Ni when compared with the normal soil elsewhere in the world. This could possibly be correlated with the surrounding rocks (ultrabasic to acidic nature) of Peshawar basin. It is evident from this study that though the waters of the piedmont aquifers are safe both for agricultural and drinking purposes but still the special measures shall be taken to protect the underground water of the area from contamination if the industries are to be established in these areas of the Peshawar basin in future.",,,"Tariq, S.; Natl.

A substantial portion of their livelihood is derived from the extraction of NTFPs. Despite the widespread dependence, little is known of the possible impacts that such extraction has on the regeneration and genetic diversity of the species. We examined the impact of anthropogenic pressures on the regeneration and genetic diversity of Phyllanthus emblica, an important NTFP species, across increasing gradients of pressures (disturbance) at two sites in the deciduous forests of south India. Our studies showed that even under moderate levels of disturbance, there was a significant decrease in the regeneration of the species. Populations close to human settlements (likely to be impacted more), had a relatively less proportion of small size class individuals than those farther away (likely to be impacted less). Several seed and seedling features were significantly affected by disturbance. Isozyme analysis indicated a decrease in percentage heterozygosity of populations with disturbance at one of the forest sites. There was a genetic structuring of the populations due to disturbance. Populations close to settlements (and hence impacted) tended to cluster in a group and were separated from those farther away (not impacted). Thus our studies showed that anthropogenic pressures can adversely affect the regeneration and genetic diversity of NTFP species in tropical forests. Further studies might be required to identify critical levels of disturbance or pressures that a species can tolerate such that protocols for its sustainable extraction can be prescribed.","Anthropogenic pressures; Disturbance; Forest communities; Forests; Genetic diversity; India; NTFP; Phyllanthus emblica; Regeneration",,"Uma Shaanker, R.; Jawaharlal Nehru Ctr.

It emphasises the need for greater value addition of NTFPs since bulk of its collection by the primary gatherers enter in to market without any processing and value addition. As a result, the sales network is squeezed, far-off market are restricted and the vicious circle of small markets aggravate the problem. This leads to a situation of low production and small surplus that make the primary gatherers more vulnerable resulting in exploitation to become more acute. The paper attempts to examine the status and potential of NTFP-based industries in the light of need for harvesting and post-harvest treatment for sustainable processing. At the background of varieties of precious NTFP potential in the State of Orissa, the paper presents a few structured models for exploitation of the wide prospects/opportunities for value addition to benefit the primary gatherers and the State exchequer in the light of present era of economic and trade liberalisation.

This article explores why NTFP harvesting suddenly emerged in North America as an ""issue"" in the early 1990s. Drawing from a three-year study of chanterelle mushroom harvesters on the Olympic Peninsula Biosphere Reserve (Washington, USA), we discuss a variety of forces which intersected in this period to bring NTFP harvesting to wider attention. Unfortunately, harvesters continue to be excluded as knowledgeable actors in, if not legitimate co-managers of, temperate forest ecosystems, resulting in both passive and active harvester resistance to research and management, a devaluing of local harvesting traditions, and missed opportunities for collaboration. We reluctantly conclude that despite ""New Forestry"" co-management rhetoric, given existing institutional barriers and positivist scientific categories, NTFP workers will likely remain excluded from active roles in temperate forest research and management-contributing in turn to the ongoing legitimacy crisis of public and private forest management entities.","Chanterelle mushroom; Forest management; Legitimacy crisis; Local knowledge; Non-timber forest products","Ecosystems; Harvesting; Managers; Timber; Forest products; Forestry; forest management; harvesting; mushroom; nontimber forest product; North America",,,,10549811,,,,"English","J.

Harvest of non-timber forest products has become more scrutinized as landowners, forest managers, and harvesters struggle to meet their sometimes conflicting needs and requirements, and deal with growing demand for many wild products. Much of the research on non-timber forest products has focused on biology and ecology, although there has been some research on the social and economic aspects of non-timber forest products over the past several decades. There are several social and economic studies of the industry that are underway or just being completed in the Pacific Northwest. Current research includes studies on product yield, market surveys, price analysis, product management and silviculture, recreational use, and policy analysis. Recommendations for future research are outlined. The non-timber forest product industry is a highly varied and frequently changing industry, with issues ranging from biological sustainability to equity. Social and economic research helps resolve questions surrounding management, harvesting, production and marketing of these highly demanded and often poorly understood products.","Non-timber forest products; NTFP industry; NTFP markets; NTFP socio-economics","Cost benefit analysis; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Managers; Timber; Socio-economic research; Forestry; forest management; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainability; United States",,,,10549811,,,,"English","J.

A somewhat more neglected aspect of the refugee-health research has been the impact of refugee flows on the geography of disease, i.e., how the spatial patterns of disease prevalence are modified through the influx and settlement of refugee populations. We examine this issue by examining the changing geography of malaria in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province (NWFP) between 1972 and 1997. Until the late 1970s, the highest incidence of malaria in the region was seen in the southern and eastern parts. During the 1980s, however, two and a half million Afghan refugees entered the NWFP and were housed in tented villages along the border and in some interior areas. As the decade progressed, there was a significant shift in the spatial pattern of malaria, with the regions of highest incidence shifting to the west and north, coinciding strongly with refugee concentrations. Our study draws attention to the manner in which refugee influx and settlement can alter the ecology of the disease system, leading to long-term changes in the geography of malaria.

This paper reviews evidence that indicates that this 'conservation through commercialisation' thesis needs to be revised. In practice, the selective nature of market demand, and the uneven distribution of resources of use value within forests, mean that with NTFP harvesting the resource can become altered and degraded. The pressures that market forces can place on local control mechanisms, and the conflicting interests of those using forest resources for subsistence and income generation, can also result in poorer users becoming disadvantaged as NTFP commercialisation is intensified. An approach that recognises such areas of conflict, and attempts to arrive at a realistic balance between development and conservation, is proposed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Three indicators of economic value - level and proportion of income, returns to labor, and proportion of gaharu collecting households per village - are used to demonstrate the multiple incentives that NTFP income can generate. The concept of incentive logic is developed as an analytical technique to show how economic values can be linked to incentives for different types of management actions. The article discusses how incentives from gaharu income were most likely linked to the stake local people had in the resource, their preferences about which forest product to harvest, and their willingness to engage in collective action. These incentives contributed to sustainability to the extent they induced actions that reduce threats to the resource. The article suggests that an understanding of the influence of economic incentives on people's resource management can be improved by recognizing three factors: the multiple incentives created by an income, the logical link of those incentives to a management action, and the influence of other sociocultural and biophysical factors on management.","Aquilaria spp.; East Kalimantan; Economic incentives; Forest income; Gaharu; Nontimber forest products","Aqualaria","Wollenberg, E.K.; Ctr. for International Forestry Res., PO Box 6596 JKPWB, Jakarta 10065, Indonesia; email: L.Wollenberg@cgiar.org",,"New York Botanical Garden Press",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

However, excessive harvests may lead to the extinction of species populations or alternatively domestication by the rural people. Domestication is likely to be facilitated if the species is adaptable, market demand is greater than the production in natural populations, profitability from cultivation is high, and there are not many job opportunities or sufficient agricultural landholding with the forest dwellers. Owing to these circumstances, amliso, a broomgrass (Thysanolaena maxima), has been domesticated in Darjeeling Himalaya during the last three decades. Amliso promotes a sustainable use of fragile and easily degradable lands, provides fuelwood and fodder during lean periods and generates income from its infructescence, commonly used as broomstick. An amliso plantation has a cycle of about six years in which five annual harvests are taken. Broomstick yield in terms of number of culms, dry matter and length of culms rises up to the third harvest and declines thereafter. A six-year plantation cycle (five harvests) can generate a net revenue of US$ 3374 ha-1 against a total investment of US$ 1995 ha-1, a return nearly 1.7 times the investment cost. Human labour accounts for 62% of the total investment. Thus, if the cultivator is self-employed as a labourer, the return goes up to 4.4 times the initial investment. The value addition pattern during movement and processing of broomstick indicates that nearly 35% of the final value realised from the customer reaches the cultivator. We show that this proportion can be raised to 52.5% if the cultivators process broomstick into brooms at the source.","Amliso; Biodiversity; Broomstick; Darjeeling; Domestication; Himalaya; India; Non-timber forest products; Thysanolaena maxima",,"Shankar, U.; G.B.

In the case of developing countries, the economic importance of NWFPs in the subsistence of their rural economies has always been recognised as important, but little is known at the moment about the income generation role of NWFPs in the industrial countries in the boreal zone. The aim of the present study has been to examine the importance of commercial wild berry picking in household economies in four rural municipalities and one modest-sized city, all of them situated in the eastern and northern parts of Finland. It has been found that berry picking has provided additional income for between 8% and 31% of households on a scale ranging between FIM 1000 and 3280 FIM (USD 167-547) for the households involved. In general it can be said that berry picking proves to be of minor importance for individual household economies, since for the majority of cases picking provides no more than 3% of annual gross income, although in a few cases professional pickers were able to earn more than 10% of their annual income in this way. For this study the factors affecting commercial picking have been examined using both the Tobit model and also models concerned with the separately estimated propensity to participate in the activity (logic) and with the intensity of the picking activity (OLS). Our econometric analysis indicates that picking intensity is highest among underemployed households, a factor which emphasises the socio-economic function of the utilisation of NWFPs even in the boreal zone.","Forest-based; Household economy; Non-wood forest products; Rural development; Socio-economic; Welfare","fruit; household income; nontimber forest product; rural economy; Finland","Kangas, K.; Faculty of Forestry, University of Joensuu, PO Box 111, Joensuu FIN-80101, Finland; email: kari.kangas@forest.joensuu.fi",,"Elsevier GmbH",11046899,,,,"English","J.

In order to assess the impact of gaharu harvesting on populations of Aquilaria spp. in Indonesia, the activities of gaharu collectors were assessed by accompanying them on collecting expeditions. Gaharu harvesting generally involved felling the tree, with 31-92% of trees encountered being felled. The quantity of gaharu obtained from each felling was extremely low, mean values ranging from 0.10-0.18 kg tree-1 to 0.19-2.13 kg tree-1 for high and low grade gaharu respectively. A combination of these values with gaharu trade figures for the early 1990s enabled the number of Aquilaria spp. trees harvested annually in Indonesia to be estimated. Values ranged from less than 30,000 to more than 100,000 trees felled, depending on the year. Field assessments of two populations of Aquilaria spp. were used to parameterize a matrix model, which was used to predict the impact of different harvesting regimes on population dynamics of the species. Values of the dominant latent root (λ) were 1.22 and 1.20 for A. malaccensis in West Kalimantan and A microcarpa in East Kalimantan respectively, indicating that both populations are self-sustaining in the absence of harvesting. Analysis of λ under different harvesting scenarios indicated that for A. malaccensis, population expansion will continue if harvesting is set at a minimum diameter at breast height (dbh) of above 10 cm, but for A. microcarpa, a population decline will occur if trees with a dbh of less than 30 cm are harvested. Given current harvesting practices, it is, therefore, unlikely that gaharu is being sustainably harvested at present. These results suggest that the gaharu trade may have had a substantial impact on the population size of Aquilaria spp. in Indonesia, and their implications are discussed in the context of setting harvest quotas for regulation of trade, as required by CITES.

F., Copenhagen, Denmark","The importance of commercial non-timber forest products (NTFPs) to the livelihood strategies of rural collectors in Nepal is increasingly recognised. This paper provides suggestions for improving rural collectors' possibilities for income generation. The formation and implementation of NTFP policies in Nepal is examined by investigating the area of interactions between policy formation, choice and implementation of forest policy tools within the 'new political economy' approach, and suggestions are subsequently evaluated within the found practical political context. The study is based on approximately 400 interviews carried out with some 1000 stakeholders in the period 1992-1998. Following a qualitative research strategy hypotheses are formulated on the basis of patterns emerging from the data collected. The main stakeholders in NTFP collection and trade are identified to be: rural collectors and traders; local level politicians; lower level government staff; high level politicians; conservation-oriented institutions; and development oriented institutions. The objectives and influence of these stakeholders on the non-timber sector are identified and proposals for change are discussed in the light of distribution of objectives and power. It is hypothesised that NTFP policy formation, implementation and the field reality are weakly connected: implemented policy tools do not correspond to the aims of formulated policies, and field reality is not regulated in the envisioned direction by policy tools. This situation is explained by the fact that stakeholders at different levels of the policy hierarchy can influence their own level only. It is further hypothesised that a number of changes in forest legislation and regulations can have immediate and powerful effects on rural livelihoods of collectors. Taking into account the present political situation such changes may not be introduced from within the decision making process and, therefore, the view is put forward that pressure from outside the forestry sector is needed to bring about significant changes in favour of rural collectors. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.","Forest legislation; Himalaya; Non-timber forest products; Patronage politics; Policy formation processes; Rural development; Social justice",,"Larsen, H.O.; Roy.

In the late 19th century, the upcoming rubber boom lead to the establishment of rubber estates. Following World War I, a first rubber crisis forced some estate owners to abandon their land, favouring the emergence of independent communities. A second rubber crisis after World War II, along with the Agrarian Reform in 1953, accelerated the disintegration of rubber estates and the foundation of independent communities. In the early 1990s, the conclusive halt of Bolivian rubber production fuelled rural-urban migration and the differentiation of rural settlements. This paper examines the evolution from pure rubber estates to a wide array of settlement types. A settlement typology distinguishes four types of estates and six types of independent communities with varying trade-offs between extractivism and peasant agriculture. The findings have important implications for NTFP-based development. First, extraction-based livelihoods are socially acceptable only when access to basic services, like schooling, health care, and transportation is ensured. Second, in the region's remote areas the supply of such services needs to rely on a forest concession system within which the private sector bears the investments needed.

The study comprised data collection (prior to and after getting training in backyard chicken production over a one year period) from 100 farmers who were eager to join female farmers groups and get training from FLEW. These one hundred farmers were initially selected from 200 farmers at random, keeping in view their eagerness for joining female farmer groups. The training included skill development, production, and breeding of highly productive stock, care of the newly hatched chicks, housing, feeding, disease prevention, and hygienic measures, control of external and internal parasites, egg selection and storage, hatchability of eggs, and its requirements, selection and culling of birds, provision of vaccines and some other medicines, and development of linkages with the Agencies and Livestock and Dairy Development Department of the Government of NWFP. No extra inputs were provided (eg: in terms of birds). Training had a significant effect on flock size, egg production morbidity, mortality, egg storage duration and hatchability of eggs. Significantly lower flock size was maintained by female farmers prior to get training (18.7±1.27) than after training (30.8±1.87 number). Egg production, per household and per bird, was significantly lower prior to training (1083±27 and 57±3.06) than after training (1629±38 and 97.6±6.66 eggs, respectively). A significantly higher number of eggs per capita per year were available for farmers after training (168±8.61) than before training (112±2.0). Mean overall morbidity and mortality per flock were significantly higher before training (53.5±1.4 and 41.8±1.38) than after training (26.5±0.92 and 17.8±0.79%, respectively). Eggs were stored for a greater (P<0.05) duration in winter (13.6±0.57 days) and summer (5.85±0.36) for hatching prior to training than after training (8.62±0.20 and 3.92±0.14 days, respectively).

A characterisation of 25 markets based on a set of products, traders, and marketplace attributes was produced. The combination of the attributes size and self-sufficiency results in four main types of markets (national, provincial, local and frontier), whereas clustering based on all the attributes clearly distinguishes the northern and southern areas of the HFZ, and an urban-rural, core-periphery relationship within each area. This separation reflects different product specialisations and diversity, as well as market size. Dacryodes and Gnetum predominate in the northern markets, which tend to be larger, whereas Garcinia lucida, G. kola and Irvingia are relatively more abundant in the southern markets. In general, larger markets are more diversified and their traders are more specialised than the smaller ones. There are also differences in product storage time, distance from source of products, level of taxation, and transportation problems. The need to understand the multiple, non-linear interactions among these factors is stressed.","Cameroon; NTFP markets; Spatial analysis","forestry production; market conditions; nontimber forest product; spatial analysis; Cameroon","Perez, M.R.; Dept.

Substantial improvement in productivity of forest resources on sustainable basis is critically important for meeting the national needs and conserving the forest resources. Innovative policy initiatives are required for reforestation of 32 million ha degraded forest areas in a time bound manner with appropriate species matching the present site conditions. Priority for reforestation should be given for areas with good soils but devoid of tree cover as it is counter productive to tackle most difficult sites first meanwhile allowing the better sites to degrade to the point of no return. As massive financial investments will be required for reforestation of degraded forest lands supplemented with genetically improved planting stock and competent professional management with accountability for results, corporate sector and all sections of society should be encouraged to participate in the national effort of reforestation.

However, because of increased access to international markets by entrepreneurs along with a growing international demand for NTFP it may be possible to double or triple Canada's harvest of NTFP. Further development of this industry should be associated with adequate training of harvesters in terms of NTFP biology in order to maximize profits while achieving biological sustainability.

Pakistan is playing its role in the exploration, development and exploitation of various economic mineral deposits of the North West Frontier province, Pakistan since 1972. In the recent past, SDA in joint collaboration with Australian International Development Bureau (AIDAB) has launched an exploratory programme on the modern scientific techniques for the exploration of preceious and base metals in Chitral District NWFP with the objective to create a data base to provide necessary informations regarding un-explored areas and investigate metallic mineral deposits of economic significant for further regional systematic minerals exploration to attract foreign investors. Keeping in view the positive and encouraging results of the AIDAB programme in Chitral the Sarhad Development Authority started geochemical exploration for Gold and Base Metals in the remaining Northern parts of NWFP i.e Hazara Division and Malakand Division on the pattern of AIDAB programme since October, 1993. The objective of the scheme ""Regional Exploration for Gold and Base Metals Hazara Division"" was to conduct first phase exploration in about 12000 sq. kms of Hazara Division NWFP on Regional scale i.c 1:250, 000 with density of each pan concentrate and -80# stream sediment samples in 10-50 km2 area. Geologically the area is related to the Indian plate and Island Arc assemblages known as Kohistan Island Arc Both the Indian plate and Island Arc are separated from each other by a deep reaching thrust known as the Main Mande Thrust (M.M.T). Along the MMT the Indian plate subjected under the Island Arc assemblages probably during the cretaceous period. The project team collected 1788 Nos of drainage samples from diffèrent streams of Hazara Division on scale 1:250, 000 in the first phase of the project (1993-98). These samples were chemically and mineralogical studied. Encouraging results were obtained and anomalous values of Au and other base metals in different parts of hazara Division were found specially in Kohistan valley, Jalkot valley, Siran and Kunhar valley (Kaghan). Based on these achievements Hazara Division has been divided into nine priority areas recommended for further detailed geo-chemical exploration in order to locate and pin point die Gold and bsae metals economic deposits in their respective areas of interest. It is worth mentioning here that a multinational company MINARCO showed their interest in the data collected by the SDA Geological team. The MINARCO analyzed the duplicate samples for 32 elements in Autralia and found the same areas of interest anomalous in Au and base metals as were found by the project geoscientists. Keeping in view the afore-mentioned results another scheme was launched to explore the areas of interest of Hazara Division in more detail i.e. on scale 1:50, 000. The scheme has been commenced from 1998 and shall be completed in the year 2001. © 2000 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

In the late 19th century, the upcoming rubber boom lead to the establishment of rubber estates. Following World War I, a first rubber crisis forced some estate owners to abandon their land, favouring the emergence of independent communities. A second rubber crisis after World War II, along with the Agrarian Reform in 1953, accelerated the disintegration of rubber estates and the foundation of independent communities. In the early 1990s, the conclusive halt of Bolivian rubber production fuelled rural-urban migration and the differentiation of rural settlements. This paper examines the evolution from pure rubber estates to a wide array of settlement types. A settlement typology distinguishes four types of estates and six types of independent communities with varying trade-offs between extractivism and peasant agriculture. The findings have important implications for NTFP-based development. First, extraction-based livelihoods are socially acceptable only when access to basic services, like schooling, health care, and transportation is ensured. Second, in the region's remote areas the supply of such services needs to rely on a forest concession system within which the private sector bears the investments needed. Finally, indigenous communities participating in NTFP trade need to demarcate their sphere in between the remote forest concessions and the non-tribal peasantry in the vicinity of town.","Amazon; Bolivia; Brazil nut; Extractivism; Non-timber forest products; Peasant agriculture; Rubber; Rural-urban migration; Settlement typology","nontimber forest product; peasant agriculture; rubber; Amazonia; Bolivia","Stoian, D.; Institute of Forest Policy, Bertoldstrasse 17, Freiburg 79085, Germany; email: stoian@uni-freiburg.de",,"A B Academic Publishers",01435698,,,,"English","Int.

Use of NTFPs starts with extraction from natural forests but may gradually be intensified to cultivation of domesticated trees. In order to enhance understanding of the evolutionary processes in NTFP production, this article analyzes the different management systems of timur (Zanthoxylum armatum) production in Nepalese forests. Products of this medicinal plant are regularly traded with India. Four different management regimes on open-access state lands, two different types of community-controlled lands, and private lands are described, each being characterized by a specific set of access regimes, organizational rules for collecting and managing timur, and management practices. A gradual increase in management intensity takes place from public lands to private lands as a result of various socio-economic and politico-legislative factors. In contrast to earlier Nepalese studies, increased market price rather than increased scarcity was found to be the most important factor inducing intensification. It is concluded that the effects of supply and demand factors on management intensity of NTFPs cannot be generalized; these effects depend on both the management and marketing characteristics of specific NTFPs.","Agroforestry; Community forestry; Domestication; Indigenous knowledge; Intensification; Nepal; Resource management; Zanthoxylum armatum (Timur)","forest management; management practice; nontimber forest product; productivity; Nepal","Wiersum, K.F.; Subdepartment of Forestry, P.O.

NTF2 is required for efficient nuclear protein import and has been shown to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP. We have used the crystal structures of rat NTF2 and its complex with RanGDP to design a mutant, W7A-NTF2, in which the affinity for xFxFG-repeat nucleoporins is reduced while wild-type binding to RanGDP is retained. The 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of W7A-NTF2 is virtually superimposable upon the wild-type protein structure, indicating that the mutation had not introduced a more general conformational change. Therefore, our data suggest that the exposed side-chain of residue 7 is crucial to the interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins. Consistent with its reduced affinity for xFxFG nucleoporins, fluorescently labelled W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the nuclear envelope of permeabilized cultured cells than wild-type NTF2 and, when microinjected into Xenopus oocytes, colloidal gold coated with W7A-NTF2 binds less strongly to the central channel of nuclear pore complexes than wild-type NTF2-coated gold. Significantly, W7A-NTF2 only weakly stimulated the nuclear import of fluorescein-labelled RanGDP, providing direct evidence that an interaction between NTF2 and xFxFG repeat-containing nucleoporins is required to mediate the nuclear import of RanGDP.","Nuclear trafficking; Nucleoporins; Transport","gold; nucleoporin; calcium binding protein; carrier protein; fungal protein; membrane protein; NSP1 protein, S cerevisiae; NTF2 protein, rat; nuclear pore protein p62; nuclear protein; nucleocytoplasmic transport protein; Nutf2 protein, mouse; Ran protein; recombinant protein; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; animal cell; article; binding affinity; cell culture; cell nucleus membrane; cell transport; conformational transition; crystal structure; fluorescence; nonhuman; oocyte; priority journal; protein binding; protein protein interaction; protein structure; rat; Xenopus laevis; amino acid sequence; animal; binding site; cell membrane permeability; chemistry; crystallization; cytology; genetics; HeLa cell; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular genetics; mouse; mutation; protein conformation; solubility; transport at the cellular level; ultrastructure; X ray crystallography; Animalia; Vertebrata; Xenopus laevis; Animals; Binding Sites; Biological Transport; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Cell Membrane Permeability; Crystallization; Crystallography, X-Ray; Fungal Proteins; Hela Cells; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Nuclear Envelope; Nuclear Proteins; Nucleocytoplasmic Transport Proteins; Oocytes; Protein Conformation; ran GTP-Binding Protein; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Solubility; Xenopus laevis","Stewart, M.; MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Rd., Cambridge CB2 2QH, United Kingdom; email: ms@mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk",,"Academic Press",00222836,,JMOBA,"10543952","English","J.

The nonvascular pendant epiphyte taxa examined were mosses (Pilotrichella flexilis, Phyllogonium viscosum, Zelometeorium sp., Squamidium leucotrichum); liverworts (Frullania convoluta and Frullania spp.); and lichens (Usnea spp.). All of these species have pendant life-forms, and apparently play key roles in water interception, thereby influencing the hydrological balance in tropical montane ecosystems. Since the growth of pendant non-vascular epiphytes conversely depends on fog and mist, these species could be used as indicators of health of the tropical montane forests where they abound. Nine years after careful selective logging, no negative impacts were detected on the biomass of these NTFPs at the heights at which they are commercially harvested (1-3 m). This result was established through comparisons of logged and non-logged plots on the basis of abundance (biomass) of the commercial bryophytes and related variables such as substrate length availability and substrate type (shade tolerant, pioneer species, or bamboo, and substrate diameter). Pendant epiphytes were most abundant on thin substrates (branches <1 cm in diameter); the highest biomass values per unit substrate length were found on branches of shade-tolerant species.","Epiphytic bryophytes; Montane cloud forests; Non-timber forest products; Reduced-impact logging","bioindicator; bryophyte; ecosystem health; epiphyte; logging; montane forest; Costa Rica; Frullania convoluta; Phyllogonium viscosum; Pilotrichella flexilis; Squamidium leucotrichum; Usnea; Zelometeorium","Romero, C.; Department of Botany, , Gainesville, FL 32611-2009, United States; email: cromero@botany.ufl.edu",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The great socio-cultural diversity and ecological complexity of the region is also matched by an unusually large variety of forest species being used. A wide range of plants, comprising herbs, shrubs and trees are used for different domestic purposes, such as food, fodder, materials for construction and handicrafts. Wild plants also play a vital role in providing primary health care in the region. In earlier times, forest products were harvested only on a subsistence basis. However, in recent decades, factors such as rising market demand, increasing population pressure, and changes in socio-cultural and socio-economic values have led to overharvesting. It is now estimated that most of the useful wild herbs in the region are overexploited and some of them have become locally extinct. Government forestry policies have, in the past, exclusively emphasized plantation and management of trees and have, unfortunately, ignored non-timber products, as these are usually of comparatively lesser economic importance. However, it is suggested that proper management of NTFP will help upgrade rural economies. Recommended policies to this effect include empowerment of local communities and their involvement in development plans as well as strengthening of indigenous knowledge. To foster sustainable use of NTFP, the following steps are also suggested: integrating traditional and scientific knowledge; safeguarding regeneration potential; cultivating wild species, making appropriate changes to extraction processes used; and establishing more transparency in prices and marketing channels.","Commercialization; NTFP; Western Himalaya","forest resource; indigenous population; medicinal plant; resource management; India; Animalia","Singh, G.S.; Center for Sustainable Environment, New Delhi, India; email: dosnad@del2.vsnl.net.in",,"Elsevier BV",01650203,,,,"English","Nat.

The magnitude of this trade amounts to thousands of millions of CFA (millions of US dollars), representing an important contribution to the country's rural economy. NWFP markets in Cameroon's HFZ offer income opportunities not only for large-scale, specialized traders, but also for many poor traders who rely on them to obtain their small cash income. Most of the traders are women, although the study found that those trading on the largest scale were men. Rural dwellers and traders deal simultaneously with NWFPs and agricultural commodities. Because of their seasonal nature, NWFPs complement agricultural commodities in improving the welfare of rural households and market traders. NWFP markets are very dynamic and are hierarchically organized into a widespread network around local, provincial and national nodes. Supply constraints for some products lead to a fairly elastic response in prices. The products are traded throughout West and Central Africa, with some reaching migrant communities in large cities of Europe. The absence of a market infrastructure (an indication of lack of institutional interest and support for NWFP trade) is an important feature common to the NWFP trade across the region. Improved market conditions and improved management systems to guarantee a stable supply are key priorities of the traders, while a need to improve the credit system is less strongly felt. A number of NWFPs from Cameroon's HFZ seem to be under increasing pressure as a result of the reduction of forests and the increasing demand - a problem for which a plantation approach may offer solutions. Reconciliation of the potential for income generation and for local development with forest conservation is one of the urgent tasks to be undertaken in Cameroon.

The policy document asserts that local communities should be motivated to identify themselves with the development and protection of the forests from which they derive benefits. Thus, the policy envisages a process of joint management of forests by the state governments (which have nominal responsibility) and the local people, which would share both the responsibility for managing the resource and the benefits that accrue from this management. Under joint forest management (JFM), village communities are entrusted with the protection and management of nearby forests. The areas concerned are usually degraded or even deforested areas. However, in Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh all village fringe forests can come under JFM. The communities are required to organize forest protection committees, village forest committees, village forest conservation and development societies, etc. Each of these bodies has an executive committee that manages its day-to-day affairs. Non-wood forest products (NWFPs) have a key role in JFM efforts. With the increasing awareness of their economic potential and growing concerns for the sustainability of the resources and the distribution of the benefits derived from them, various state governments have taken over control of a number of NWFPs.

An underlying assumption of the interest in NWFPs is that sustainable economic harvest of 'secondary' products will help avoid forest conversion to other economic land uses or extensive logging. However, this approach has recently been recognized as somewhat simplified; accumulated experience, including evidence of unsustainable extraction and negative socio-economic impacts, has led to a more complex view.

Enterprises based on non-wood forest products (NWFPs) have attracted attention for their potential to make forest use more sustainable, both because they extend the range of forest benefits and because gathering and processing activities can be managed by communities near the forest resource, with a greater portion of the end-product revenues returning to those who manage the resource. General discussions of the potential of NWFPs and their international markets have often overshadowed the actual experiences of many community-based enterprises and their success stories, of which several are presented in this article. The main requirements for successful non-wood forest enterprises and sustainable forest management are strong local institutions and clear, supportive national policies (particularly related to land rights and marketing), rather than international markets. Experience suggests that for almost any forest product, international demand alone is more likely to yield only short-term economic gain and to lead to forest destruction.",,"forest resource; industrial development; nontimber forest product; rural economy","",,,00416436,,,,"English","Unasylva",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032712526

The results showed that nearly all the socio-demographic, economic and environmental variables were significantly associated with H/A and Wt/A. Children most likely to be stunted and underweight were those whose mothers were aged 40-44 years, mothers with no education, children from rural areas and children with birth interval <24 months. The multivariate analyses for Height/A model showed succeeding birth interval >24 months, mother's age, her education and having toilet facilities in the house positively associated with growth attainment. For the Weight/A model succeeding birth interval >24 months, mother's age, her education and having toilet facilities and electricity in the house, and living in Punjab and NWFP province positively associated with growth attainment.

Three land use options are simulated for four selected catchments in the Hulu Langat Forest Reserves (HLFR), Selangor, Malaysia. These options are no logging or catchment protection (CP), reduced impact logging (RIL) and conventional logging (CL). The potential sedimentation impacts of each option on the dam and water intake ponds in the catchments are calculated. The benefits derived from logging, hydro-electric power (HEP) generation and the water regulatory dam for water treatment and the external costs emanating from the sedimentation under the three options are estimated. The computations are based on data collected from previous studies conducted in adjacent areas with similar hydrological parameters, secondary data from published reports by various departmental agencies and from on-site personnel surveys. Analysis at the compartment level suggests that the central issue of joint production in forested catchments is not the selection of which logging methods to adopt. Rather the point is which water use can be combined with timber production that can generate greater NPV than the status quo CP option. Under both logging methods, the returns from timber cannot meet that from the status quo production of treated water. Complementing water uses with logging in forested catchments is efficient in HEP catchments. The efficient choice among the two logging methods is the RIL option because of its higher returns and the lower externality imposed upon the status quo water user. However, despite the imposition of conservational measures, the RIL option still generates sediment loads that impose substantial external costs on the downstream water users. This analysis does not incorporate the effects of the alternative logging options on the other attributes of natural forests such as recreation, bio-diversity values and non-timber forest products (NTFP).",,"Nucleopolyhedrovirus",,,"Cambridge University Press",1355770X,,,,"English","Environ.

An analytical method is developed and applied to two case studies of communities managing a mixed teak forest system and a sal coppice forest system. The analytical results show that: (i) Economic returns to JFM are considerable in both forest systems; (ii) There is an increase in revenues from the forest to the communities but a theoretical loss to forest departments; (iii) Income flows into the communities increase significantly, though in the sal coppice system this is partially offset by declining income from collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs); (iv) The benefits of JFM are not always distributed equally, which may result in collectors of firewood and some NTFPs losing, even though overall gains are sufficient to compensate losers. The realization of benefits is dependent on an enabling environment consisting of complex institutional and social conditions, in particular the representativeness and functioning of the village forest committee, the regulatory framework and sharing arrangements, and the regional economic and marketing context. The method needs to be more widely tested in a variety of social and environmental conditions and the results from these two case studies can only be extrapolated with caution. Nevertheless, they point to significant economic and financial benefits to communities, and the need for specific measures to safeguard the interests of those who may lose as a result of unequal distribution of the benefits.",,,"Hill, I.; World Bank, Washington, DC, United States",,,02537494,,,,"English","World Bank Tech.

Conservation International and El Cruce a Dos Aguadas (El Cruce). and agricultural community in the Maya Biosphere Reserve in Northern Peten, have created a new NTFP, called Gatherings(TM) which is a potpourri composed of seeds, flowers and leaves. Gatherings(TM) is promoted on international and domestic markets as a sustainably extracted natural product whose sate provides a direct incentive for local producers to conserve their forests. The purpose of this investigation is to test the ecological sustainability of extraction of the natural dyes used to color the potpourri ingredients and to present the following eight-step method for testing the sustainability of NTFP harvesting: (1) delineate current supply area; (2) determine current supply; (3) estimate the growth and yield of target species; (4) determine the current demand; (5) compare short-term supply and demand and evaluate management options: (6) assess secondary ecological effects of harvesting; (7) repeat the process for future time periods; and (8) summarize the analysis. Using this method, we found that two of the dyes are likely to be over-harvested within 10 years, and that the harvest of the third could be increased substantially without endangering the dye-producing species. When we summarized the analysis, we found no evidence to conclude that the current production of Gatherings(TM) directly benefits the forests of El Cruce. However, the goodwill created by this project has contributed to a new conservation initiative; a Land Management Area which has been proposed by the community to Guatemala's National Protected Areas Council (CONAP) and which contains a 13273 ha forest reserve.","Conservation; Dyes; Forest products; Guatemala; Peten; Sustainable","forestry production; harvesting; nontimber forest product; sustainable forestry; Guatemala; natural dye; yield","Gould, K.650 Carlinda Ave., Columbia, MD 21046, United States; email: edgoule@erols.com",,,03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

The substitution of dba by the phosphine in Pd(dba)L2 to form SPdL3 is easier for L = TPF than for L = PPh3. The less ligated complex SPd(TFP)2 is the reactive species in the oxidative addition with phenyl iodide. In THF, {Pd(dba)2 + nTFP}, a mixture often used as a catalyst promoter in several synthetic organic reactions, is found to be less reactive than {Pd(dba)2 + nPPh3} for small values of n (n = 2 or 4) whereas it is more reactive for higher values of n (n &gt; 6). Conversely, in DMF, {Pd(dba)2 + nTFP} is always found to be more reactive than {Pd(dba)2 + nPPh3} whatever n (n ≥ 2).",,,"Amatore, C.; Département de Chimie, 24 Rue Lhomond, 75231 Paris Cedex 5, France",,"American Chemical Society",02767333,,ORGND,,"English","Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000549384

We investigated the risk factors associated with maternal mortality in sixteen rural districts of Balochistan and the North-West Frontier (NWFP) provinces of Pakistan. We designed a nested case-control study comprising 261 cases (maternal deaths reported during last five years) and 9135 controls (women who survived a pregnancy during last five years). Using contextual analysis, we estimated the interactions between the biological risk factors of maternal mortality and the district-level indicators of health services. Women under 19 or over 39 yr of age, those having their first birth, and those having a previous history of fetal loss were at greater risk of maternal death. Staffing patterns of peripheral health facilities in the district and accessibility of essential obstetric care (EOC) were significantly associated with maternal mortality. These indicators also modified the effects of the biological risk factors of maternal mortality. For example, nulliparous women living in the under-served districts were at greater risk than those living in the better-served districts. Our results are consistent with several studies which have pointed out the role of health services in the causation of maternal mortality. Many such studies have implicated distance to hospital (an indicator of access to EOC) and lack of prenatal care as major determinants of maternal mortality. We conclude that better staffing of peripheral health facilities and improved access to EOC could reduce the risk of maternal mortality among women in rural Balochistan and the NWFP.","Contextual analysis; Health services indicators; Maternal mortality; Rural Pakistan","health risk; maternal health; medical geography; mortality; risk factor; rural population; adolescent; adult; article; case control study; controlled study; female; health care access; health care facility; health care personnel; human; major clinical study; maternal mortality; obstetric care; pakistan; prenatal care; risk assessment; risk factor; rural area; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Case-Control Studies; Cause of Death; Confidence Intervals; Databases, Factual; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Health Surveys; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Logistic Models; Maternal Health Services; Maternal Mortality; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pakistan; Pregnancy; Reproductive History; Risk Factors; Rural Health; Pakistan","Midhet, F.; Natl.

In addition, many NTFPs, are collected for household consumption and thus provide food security to several needy people. Most NTFPs have potential for value addition at local level so that more employment and income can be generated in the village economy. The multiplier impacts of this is expected to be substantial in the local economy. The scope for value addition is high and is possible by 200% or more of the value of the raw or unprocessed NTFPs. Enforcement of grades and standardization is another way of adding value to raw produce of NTFPs.

Six species are most commonly extracted from BRT scrub for subsistence and income generation by an aboriginal tribe, the Soliga. Although the forest has been provided protection from indiscriminate felling since 1978 under a wildlife sanctuary cover, changes in vegetation structure are still occurring as a consequence of anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of fuelwood and other NTFPs. The results indicate that large woody species are being replaced by small woody species. The population structure also is becoming increasingly skewed to the smaller size classes due to extraction-bound mortality of the individuals, particularly those >7 cm dbh and above. The data suggest that the scrub community itself may be a manifestation of long persisting anthropogenic pressure in the form of extraction of a variety of forest products, and it currently represents a downward transition from a deciduous forest to a shrub thicket.","Basal area; Density; NTFP extraction; Population structure; Regeneration; Scrub forest; Species richness",,"Bawa, K.S.; Department of Biology, , Boston, MA 02125, United States",,"Springer New York LLC",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

If construction is inaccurate then inequity of water delivery is built into the system from the onset. A survey of hydraulic performance of Kalpani distributary in NWFP Pakistan immediately after construction showed that the canal could only deliver 90% of designed discharge due to deficiencies in construction of two siphons, and that the tail end of the canal only received 70% of designed discharge. When operated at 70% of design discharge tail end reaches received 50% of designed discharge. Measurements of outlet structures showed that 57% of structures were built as intended and had not been damaged. All orifice outlets delivered more than 115% of design discharge and on average delivered 40% more than intended. Only 20% of open flumes were within 10% of design width, while 58% were more than 30% wider. As a result of these construction defects many watercourses were able to obtain much higher discharges than intended. The lack of control gates means there is no managerial remedy to redress the existing inequity. The only solution is to reconstruct a high proportion of outlet structures. Potential causes of poor construction are many, including lack of involvement of the agency responsible for subsequent operation, lack of dialogue with water users, and lack of accountability built into the project framework.","Construction; Equity; Hydraulic performance; Institutions; Modernization; Participation; Rehabilitation; Water distribution","Discharge (fluid mechanics); Structural design; Water supply; Hydraulic performance; Irrigation canals; canal; construction; irrigation system; performance assessment; water management; Pakistan","Murray-Rust, D.H.; Dept. of Irrigat. and Water Eng., Nieuwe Kanaal 11, 6709 PA Wageningen, Netherlands",,"Springer Netherlands",01686291,,IDRSE,,"English","Irrig Drain Syst",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032215097

An analytical method is developed and applied to two case studies of communities managing a mixed teak forest system and a sal coppice forest system. The analytical results show that: 1) Economic returns to JFM are considerable in both forest systems; 2) There is an increase in revenues from the forest to the communities but a theoretical loss to forest departments; 3) Income flows into the communities increase significantly, though in the sal coppice system this is partially offset by declining income from collection of non-timber forest products (NTFPs); 4) The benefits of JFM are not always distributed equally, which may result in collectors of firewood and some NTFPs losing, even though overall gains are sufficient to compensate losers. The realization of benefits is dependent on an enabling environment consisting of complex institutional and social conditions, in particular the representativeness and functioning of the village forest committee, the regulatory framework and sharing arrangements, and the regional economic and marketing context. The method needs to be more widely tested in a variety of social and environmental conditions and the results from these two case studies can only be extrapolated with caution. Nevertheless, they point to significant economic and financial benefits to communities, and the need for specific measures to safeguard the interests of those who may lose as a result of unequal distribution of the benefits.",,"community participation; community resource management; distribution of benefits; forest management; forestry trade; India",,,,02537494,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031809222

Methods: Information from the PMRC records on the socioeconomic and demographic situation over the last 10 years and anthropometric measurements made on all infants from 1986-96 were collected and analysed. Results: The demographic data showed a number of changes, namely a reduction in birth rate and improvements in perinatal, neonatal, infant and child mortality rates. Literacy in the village was poor (27 and 39% literate in 1986 and 1996, respectively) and female literacy showed no improvement (14%). Improvements in sanitation and in the water supply introduced by the PMRC had limited success, as clean water was subsequently contaminated by unclean hands and utensils, and 50% of the population continued to use open fields for sanitation. In 1986 only 27% of children 0-5 years were vaccinated, but by 1996, 96% of children had completed polio, diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus (DPT) and bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programmes and 95% of women of child-bearing age were vaccinated against tetanus. Protection against tetanus reduced neonatal deaths and from 1993 onwards there have been no further cases. Anthropometric data for the period 1986-96 for infants (0-24 months) showed that at birth the majority of infants were close to the 50th National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) centile for weight and length, and only 5% of birth-weights were less than 2.5 kg. Growth charts showed faltering in length and weight and by 24-months length in both boys and girls was below the 3rd NCHS centile and weights were just above. Conclusions: Reductions in child mortality have occurred over the period 1986-96.

The adverse effect is reflected by way of natural resource degradation, leading to reduction in productivity which ends up in enhanced poverty and misery. Poverty, malnutrition and illiteracy are the main causes of population growth that further accentuates the degradation process. This, ultimately forms a vicious circle of natural resource degradation including forests. To conserve our forests, by and large, foresters concentrated on 'tree', without appreciating the interdependence of various facets of the vicious circle. Forestry is not an end in itself. It ought to be looked as an integral part of the eco-system, operating within the social, political and economic framework. Forestry is for people. Since traditional forestry management focussed only on single aspects of the vicious circle, no tangible achievements in respect of reversing or arresting the trend of degradation were forthcoming. The Total Forest Management (TFM) is an innovative approach for conservation of forests, which attempts to address the malady in totality by keeping 'people' in the centre. The local people, local resource and local technology constitute the cornerstones of the green triangle which operates within the socio-political milieu so that the human aspect is taken care of. The system is being tried in five different areas of Madhya Pradesh by developing a package of 'hardware' of physical activities and 'software' of human sensitivities, which help in productivity enhancement through on farm and off farm activities. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP), with its attendant instrumentalities constitute the back bone of the system. The result is that the forest dwellers are not mere passive recipients of the programme but have become active partners in the endeavour and in many cases even proud owner of the hardware.",,,"",,,00194816,,IFORA,,"English","Ind Forester",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244323954

Information on the abundance and distribution of tree species, and local and national ethnobotanical surveys were used classifying species into five categories (timber, construction, technological, edible and medicinal). A total of 152 species were recorded from the two localities; covering 236 different uses, 33 known commercial timber species and 106 species with potential non-timber product utilization. The most important plant families with the highest number of uses at both localities were Leguminosae (subfamilies Caesalpinioideae and Mimosoideae), Arecaceae, Bombacaceae and Chrysobalanaceae, although these families were not the most abundant families at both localities. At both forest localities eight tree species represented over 50% of all the trees. At Kurupukari three species, each with more than three identified NTFPs, represented over 20% of the trees. Potential utilization of NTFPs are discussed in accordance with species richness, tree density, the number of different uses per species, and the percentage of trees represented by each utilizable species. Considering the constraints on the future potential commercialization of NTFPs, two scenarios for the extraction of NTFPs are discussed. Within relatively species-rich forest types the high diversity of products provides potentially viable multiple-species extractionism. In contrast, in low-diversity forest types, typical of the Guiana Shield, one or two NTFP species frequently represent over 50% of the canopy trees, and therefore substantially increase the potential sustainable extraction for single-species harvesting. It is suggested that these low-diversity types of forest are prioritized for conservation on the basis of ensuring future utilization, refuge, of non-timber forest products.","Guyana; Iwokrama; Low-diversity forests; Non-timber forest products; Species dominance; Tropical forest conservation","forest product; forest resources; forest type; non-timber forest product; resources assessment; tree species; tropical tree; Guyana; Arecaceae; Bomnbacaceae; Caesalpiniaceae; Chrysobalanaceae; Mimosaceae","Johnston, M.; Department of Envtl.

During the last five decades, the state system passed through various phases of centralism, populism, and constitutional engineering by the military-bureaucratic establishment as well as Islamisation, largely at the expense of provincial autonomy and a sense of participation in the business of the state shared by all communities. Non-recognition of electoral mandate as the final source of legitimacy led to the emergence of ethnic movements in East Pakistan, the NWFP. Balochistan, and Sindh. The perceived Punjabisation of the state has created feelings of ethnic hostility among all regions other than Punjab. Social insecurities caused by rapid social change, such as urbanisation in general and in-migration in Karachi in particular, have fuelled ethnic hatred all around. Similarly, the influx of refugees from neighbouring countries, along with arms and drug trafficking, has led to new patterns of identity politics and higher levels of political violence. The state's relative non-performance at the local level has pushed many sectarian groups to exit from the parliamentary framework of politics towards a blatant use of arms. What is needed is the creation of a third tier of government at the district and sub-district levels. At the top of the priority list should be a policy of decentralisation and a continuity in the electoral process to bring the recalcitrant elements into the mainstream, de-weaponisation, and strengthening of political parties as interest-aggregating and policy-bearing institutions.",,"conflict management; national politics; political development; state role; Pakistan","Waseem, M.; St. Anthony's College, United Kingdom",,"Pakistan Institute of Development Economics",00309729,,,,"English","Pak.

The productivity, revenues and costs associated with traditional household management of acai were examined in secondary forests and in homegardens. The present value of the net revenue (NPV) of lands managed for fruit and palm-heart was calculated at different distances from the central market of Belem, Para, Brazil. Intensity of acai management was dependent on distance from the market and household resources, ranging from simple collection in natural forest to intense cultivation. All calculations of revenues accounted for variation in prices due to seasonality of production. Acai was found to be a highly valuable production system even at high rates of interest. At a 15% interest rate, the net present values were US$ 1337-2693 ha-1 in managed secondary forests and US$ 4266-6930 ha-1 in homegardens.","Amazon; Euterpe oleracea; Non-timber forest products; Palms","Euterpe oleracea; acai palm; developing country; economic analysis; forest products; non-timber forest product; non-timber products; palm cultivation; palm management; Brazil, Para State","Montagnini, F.; Yale Sch. of Forestry/Envtl.

This paper describes NTFP harvest and trade, the roles of producers, traders, and processors, and the relationships between them. Five potential improvements are discussed from the perspective of harvesters in Nepal: increased production; direct marketing to bypass intermediaries; improved access to market information; improvements to raw material quality; and small-scale processing at the local level. Developments are more likely to benefit harvesters if they act collectively. Collective institutions that focus solely on the production of NTFPs may need to be developed. There are doubts that a single institution would be capable of carrying out several functions, i.e., production, marketing, and processing of NTFPs. The considerable regional variations in the nature of the NTFP trade indicate that suitable institutions, and interventions, would need to be highly location-specific. As a generalization, development efforts may be more suited to the remote western half of Nepal.",,"Miletinae; developing country; forest products; natural resources; non-timber forest product; non-timber products; trade; trade volume; Nepal","Edwards, D.M.; Nepal-UK Forestry Research Project, P.O.

We present the results of a study that seeks to evaluate the reliance of an indigenous group on non-timber forest products for cash income. Furthermore, we examine the effect of household variables on the cash income derived from collection and the price appreciation of non-timber forest products. These products account for nearly half of the gross annual income earned by the Soliga households in the Biligiri Rangan Hills of the Karnataka State in South India. Econometric models indicate that although income derived from the extraction of non-timber forest products is high in proportion to the time devoted to the collection, the extraction is not a preferred vocation. Furthermore, appreciation for non- timber forest products varies for different products and, overall, the Soligas obtain essentially minimal wages for their extractive efforts.

Two sites, distant (DS) and proximal (PS), were identified based on the proximity to a Soliga settlement. The frequency of different size classes indicates that regeneration overall is poor in the area. The two sites show differences in species richness, basal area, and tree mortality. Furthermore, non-timber forest product species show a greater deficit of small size classes than the timber forest species, suggesting that regeneration is affected by collection of seeds and fruits from non-timber forest product species. Regeneration, however, may also be affected by other anthropogenic pressures such as fire, grazing and competition with weeds.","Forest regeneration; Human usage; Non-timber forest products (NTFPs); Soligas",,"Bawa, K.S.; Department of Biology, , Boston, MA 02125, United States",,"New York Botanical Garden Press",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ.

This is also seen in the boys' school in Pakistan. Cost of providing education are a function of the availability of teachers and schools, opportunity cost of employment, urbanisation and female literacy. The growth in both recurring and capital outlays and in output costs per student are higher for girls and boys except in Balochistan. Using a pooled time series and analysis the paper concludes that there is an optimal level for the availability of schools per 1000 population [6.02 and 5.67 respectively for girls and boys in the Punjab and 3.88 for boys in NWFP and Balochistan] and for the number of teachers per 1000 students [7.69 for girls and 3.36 for boys].

Its importance is recognized as a watershed too. Having considered the current disastrous land use practices such as cardamom production and shifting cultivation, it has been decided to conserve the forest. The Forest Department is in the process of preparing the conservation plan for the area. There are about 48 villages on he periphery of the forest. Objectives of the study are to assess the forest dependencof the peripheral communities and to estimate the potential income losses due to the conservation program. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire from 80 households in four villages on the periphery of the forest. The rural economy is described using afarming systems approach. Income contributed by each activity in the fanning system and income losses due to the conservation program under three assumed degrees of protection are estimated. Results reveal that there are nine components of the farming system which utilize resources from village and forest resource systems. Of these, cardamom production, shifting cultivation and extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) are based on forest resources. Livestock activities utilize resources from both resource systems. The studied communities are heavily dependent on forest resources since, on average, 58.3% of the total income and 59.4% of the monetary income are earned from forest resources. The average annual income loss per family is estimated to be US$817.5 (58.3% of the total income) if the conservation program restricts the utilization of forest resources completely.If cardamom production and shifting cultivalion are banned, which is most likely to happen, lost income per family will be $592.3 per year (42.2% of the total income). Restrictions to use all forest resources will cause greater income losses on high-income groups. Restriction to use NTFPs will cause more income losses for low-income groups. Since community participation, one of che keys to the success of a conservation program, will be minimal, the incorporation of economic incentives into the conservation program should be studied to mitigate income losses. © 1995 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Sporadic cases are now widely reported from the Northern Areas, parts of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Punjab Province, together with Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). Two hundred and thirty-nine cases, mostly young children, have been reported in the last decade; 52% were under 2 years old, and 86% were aged less than 5 years; the male:female ratio was 3:1. In a cross sectional study of the population in 14 endemic villages, 1938 individuals of all ages were randomly skin-tested with leishmanin and 27.4% gave a positive result. The leishmanin response rate increased with age. In some areas, almost 70% of the adults over 40 years old were positive. Leishmanin positivity appeared to cluster among households (P = 0.0003), but clinical cases among households did not (P = 0.472). The leishmanin response pattern in the foci of Chilas and AJK reflected an endemic pattern of disease, whereas that seen in the Baltistan foci suggested interrupted transmission. Human sera collected in endemic villages were tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, 580 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and direct agglutination test (DAT), and another 1403, as blood samples on filter paper, were tested by DAT alone. Isolations of Leishmania were made from 15 patients, 11 from bone marrow, 3 from normal skin and one from spleen.

It is also important as a watershed which feeds the Mahaweli reservoir system. Having considered the present hazardous land-use practices such as cardamum production and shifting cultivation, the Knuckles range has been declared a national wilderness area. The Forest Department is in the process of preparing the management plan for the area. There are about 48 villages in the vicinity of the forest. This study attempts to estimate the composition of income in the peripheral communities, ticularly the extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFP) from this range of forests. Data were collected using structured questionnaires from 60 households in three villages in the vicinity of the forest. The rural economy is described using a farming systems approach and the net income contributed by each activity in the farming system was estimated. Results show that nine components of the farming system use resources from the village and the forest, with at least 47 plant species used by the villagers for different purposes. Cardamum production and shifting cultivation contribute significantly to the total income of the household, but the majority of households in the study depend upon forest resources to supply some portion of their income. Nevertheless, the monetary value of the annual income generated by NTFP is much lower than income from either cardamum production or shifting cultivation. If cardamum production and shifting cultivation are to be restricted under the conservation program, there could be additional pressure put on NTFP. Therefore, we suggest a study of the natural regen-eration capacity of selected NTFP; such information should be used in finalizing the management plan in the Knuckles range of forests. © 1993 The New York Botanical Garden.","economic valuation; non-timber forest products; Sri Lanka; tropical forests",,"Gunatilake, H.M.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Sri Lanka",,"Springer-Verlag",00130001,,ECBOA,,"English","Econ Bot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000722316

The traditional usufruct rights that the poor enjoyed have been gradually eroded by state control. This process has accelerated with increases in the prices of timber and industrial wood products. Non-timber forest products collected by the poor do not enter the system of national accounts, which results in the undervaluation of the forest wealth of the country. According to some estimates, the total demand for these products outstrips the sustainable yield of the forests in India. To ensure the best use of the forests, it is necessary for rural communities to share the responsibility of forest management with the forest departments. A proposed joint forestry project in South India is discussed as a case study of this innovative approach to forest management.

Through a number of case studies which examine the history of the exploitation of some of the main NTFPs of the Amazon, it shows that due to a number of inter-related factors, the outlook for the sustainability of NTFP-based natural forest management, if left solely to market forces, is poor. These factors include the ephemeral nature of the markets for many of these products, often due to the substitution of natural products by synthetics; substitution by plantation products; tenure insecurity and government policies that encourage alternative land uses; destructive harvesting techniques; and exploitative commercialization systems in which the extractors receive insufficient incentive to manage the resource sustainably.

The volume of net inter-provincial migration in Pakistan between 1971-81 is estimated with the use of the census survival ratio method. The analysis of net migration estimates presented confirms the fact that migration is age selective and that it mostly occurs to areas where more job opportunities and other facilities are available. The large number of young migrants, particularly of out-migrants in Punjab, and in-migrants in all other provinces expecially Balochistan and Islamabad, obviously affected the socioeconomic structure of these areas. There was higher net in-migration in the older age groups among the migrants of Punjab, but there was also net out-migration among older ages in the migrants of Sindh, NWFP, and Islamabad.

In the first model, it is assumed that the frontier itself does not vary with time, while in the second, the frontier is allowed to move. These models are applied to four years of panel data on wheat farmers in four districts of Pakistan: Faisalabad and Attock in the Punjab, Badin in Sindh, and Dir in the NWFP. Using essentially the same stochastic frontier production function in each of the four districts involved, different stochastic specifications for the inefficiency effects are obtained for the different districts. Technical efficiencies of production of the individual farmers are predicted in each year in which they are observed. Varying patterns of technical inefficiency are observed. The null hypothesis (of no technical inefficiency) cannot be rejected in only one district. In the other districts, while inefficiencies appear to be present in all of them, they are declining at a fairly rapid pace in one. The results highlight the importance of analysis at a disaggregated level because it is clear that both the rate of technical change and relative efficiencies vary across regions and explicit cognisance must be taken of this both in research and policy formulation. -Authors",,"developing country; inefficiency effect; modelling approach; stochastic frontier production function; technical inefficiency; wheat production; Attock; Badin; Dir; Faisalabad; Northwest Frontier Province; Pakistan; Punjab; Sindh",,,,00309729,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027704642

Drawing on Brazilian case studies from Acre (NTFP extraction) and northeastern Para (ranching and logging), we compare the ecological impacts of these three land uses and conclude that biotic impoverishment associated with them is qualitatively similar but quantitatively distinct. Each land use reduces populations of native plant and animal species and reduces mature forest cover. Forest conversion to pasture, practiced by both ranchers and, to a lesser extent, NTFP extractors, clearly provokes the greatest biotic impoverishment of the activities discussed, for it can virtually eliminate the native biota, reduces carbon storage in biomass, alters hydrology and, potentially, provokes regional climate change. For NTFP extraction to succeed as a conservation/development strategy, extractor populations will require reliable sources of income that reduce the attractiveness of pasture formation. Once organized, extractor groups may increase income by marketing new NTFPs and enriching abandoned agricultural plots with economically valuable trees. -from Authors",,"biotic impoverishment; cattle ranching; developing country; ecological impact; environmental impact; extractive reserve; extractor group; forest area; forest products; habitat destruction; logging; logging impact; non-timber forest product; rain forest; ranching; rubber tapping; timber harvesting; Acre; Acre State; Amazon; Brazil; Para; Para State",,"Nepstad D.C.Schwartzman S.","New York Botanical Garden; Advances in Economic Botany, 9",,,,,"English",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0027044339

We estimate the additively decomposable class of poverty measures suggested by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke. Using the method developed by Kakwani we can estimate standard errors for the headcount poverty measure, so as to provide distribution-free asymptotic confidence intervals. Rural poverty in Pakistan declined remarkably from 1984-85 to 1987-88. In terms of the headcount measure (P0) it declined from 21.1% to 15.5% for the country as a whole.

Socio-economical factors, sudden urbanisation and psychological stress may influence the pattern of tuberculosis morbidity and infection among refugees as compared with the original population. In order to study the prevalence of tuberculous infection among Afghan children a tuberculin survey was carried out in April and May 1985 on a cluster sample of male children attending the first two grades of primary schools in refugee camps in the NWFP. The sample size was 4108 male children with an average age of 8 years. 1358 of them, average age of 7.8 years, had not been vaccinated with BCG. An infection prevalence of 13.8 % was found when using a transverse diameter of 10 mm induration or more for the tuberculin test as the criterion for infection. The findings were compared with the results of a national sample survey carried out in Afghanistan in 1978: a downward trend of the annual risk of infection (ARI) of 7.8 % per year was found in children of the same age group. Thus, Afghan children living in refugee camps in NWFP showed a lower ARI than was observed in their homeland 7 years earlier. © 1989.",,"child; human; lung tuberculosis; priority journal; tuberculin test; Afghanistan; BCG Vaccine; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Human; Male; Pakistan; Refugees; Tuberculin Test; Tuberculosis","Bugiani, M.; Directorate General for Development Co-operation Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Rome, Italy",,,00413879,,TUBEA,"2617691","English","Tubercle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024385869

The overall infestation rate was 36.7%, with females showing a higher prevalence (41.5%) than males (27.7%). The prevalence did not differ significantly with locality, and exhibited only a slight seasonal variation. Pediculosis was high in the five to 19 year old age-group, beyond which it decreased, gradually in females and abruptly in males. Higher rate of infestation in females could be attributed to their long hair. A significant negative association between pediculosis and dandruff was noticed in males but not in females. Crowding and low level of education, which reflect poor socio-economic status, apparently contributed to higher rate of infestation. Prevalence was directly related to the number of children per family, suggesting that school children perhaps play an important role in the distribution of lice. Intensity of infestation, like prevalence, was higher in females than males, and decreased with age in both sexes.",,"age; arthropod; ethnic or racial aspects; female; human; male; Pakistan; parasite prevalence; pediculosis; sex difference",,,,00034983,,ATMPA,"2619367","English","ANN.

The LC50 values indicated that there was a fourfold difference in susceptibility to malathion among the strains. 3-Nonylthio-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (NTFP), a carboxylesterase inhibitor, synergized the toxicity of the insecticide when four fly strains were exposed to a mixture of the inhibitor and malathion. Whole-body homogenates of adults were analyzed by wide-range isoelectric focusing (IEF). Carboxylesterase activities on the gels were stained using common substrates such as α- and β-naphthyl acetate and p-nitrophenyl acetate. Less conventional substrates, ethyl and isobutyl carbonates of α-naphthol and p-nitrophenol, were synthesized and used for staining gels and kinetics in solution. Two major bands of activity (pI 4.4 and 4.0) were detected with naphthyl substrates. A major peak of malathion hydrolytic activity (pI 6.3) was detected by running spectrophotometric assays for carboxylesterase activity on malathion using IEF gel slices and a rapid, semiautomated assay method. The peak region of activity on malathion did not coincide with bands obtained when naphthyl substrates were used to stain the gels. NTFP inhibited malathion hydrolysis in a solution from the IEF peak of activity and also inhibited esterase activity on α-naphthyl acetate on the gels. Recovered carboxylesterase activities on malathion and O-ethyl carbonate of p-nitrophenol were higher in the cytosolic than in the microsomal or mitochondrial cell fractions. © 1987.",,"carboxylesterase; malathion; arthropod; drosophila melanogaster","Ashour, M.-B.A.; Department of Entomology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, United States",,,00483575,,PCBPB,,"English","Pestic.
